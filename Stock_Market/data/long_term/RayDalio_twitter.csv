1527650408239226881,2022-05-20 14:00:14+00:00,128,9,Similarly if an economy turns bad enough those responsible for running it will make the political and policy changes that are needed or they will not survive making room for their replacements to come along 3 4
1527650406783803392,2022-05-20 14:00:14+00:00,71,6,For example if there is too much supply and waste in a market prices will go down companies will go out of business and capacity will be reduced until the supply falls in line with the demand at which time the cycle will start to move in the opposite direction 2 4
1527650404791504897,2022-05-20 14:00:13+00:00,568,111,This evolutionary cycle is not just for people but for countries companies economies for everything And it is naturally self correcting as a whole though not necessarily for its parts 1 4

1526921589652041734,2022-05-18 13:44:10+00:00,578,108,For example if you come up with something the world values you almost can t help but be rewarded Conversely reality tends to penalize those people species and things that don t work well and detract from evolution principleoftheday
