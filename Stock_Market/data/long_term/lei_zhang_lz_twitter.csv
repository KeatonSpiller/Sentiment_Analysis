1296243301612429317,2020-08-20 00:31:00+00:00,2,1,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1296243301612429317,PPI showed the putamen as the target region But what computational signal does it carry out We used the same approach for RPE and found an interesting social prediction error representation We actually encourage using this approach to justify any errorlike signals 1115
1296243299649564682,2020-08-20 00:31:00+00:00,1,1,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1296243299649564682,Now that we have these brain regions how do they interact Could it be possible that the brains rewardrelated regions covary with socialrelated regions For this we used simple connectivity analyses 1015
1296243297594351618,2020-08-20 00:30:59+00:00,3,0,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1296243297594351618,We also found the wellknown reward prediction error RPE in VSNAcc We looked into RPEs subcomponents to justify that VS is encoding RPE rather than outcome valence We recently articulated this approach in a tutorial paper 915
1296243295509774337,2020-08-20 00:30:59+00:00,15,3,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1296243295509774337,We observed dissociable value signals value from direct learning is only associated with vmPFC yet value from social learning is only related to ACC This is nicely compatible with a fab recent review on social learning by etal 815
1296243293735583744,2020-08-20 00:30:58+00:00,5,0,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1296243293735583744,Within each group we scanned one persons brain with fMRI This allowed us to measure when and where the brain carries out value computations from direct learning amp social learning and to characterize their potentially distinct neural signatures 715
1296243291403563008,2020-08-20 00:30:58+00:00,8,3,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1296243291403563008,So we put these elements altogether built a comprehensive model Option values were updated via both direct learning counterfactual RL amp social learning discounted cumulative reward history to guide future choices We used stan to estimate models hierarchically 615

1296243286806585345,2020-08-20 00:30:57+00:00,3,0,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1296243286806585345,Not surprisingly we saw that the more opposite choices the more people switched but they increased their confidence bet when seeing agreeing choices On top of previous literature it is interesting to see how group coherence playes a role here 415
1296243284101275649,2020-08-20 00:30:56+00:00,6,0,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1296243284101275649,We used a classic probabilistic reversal learning task but in a social context we invited 5 people each time and after each participant made their choice they could observe what the others had chosen next everyone could make adjustments followed by outcomes 315
1296243281626574849,2020-08-20 00:30:56+00:00,5,0,https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1296243281626574849,We make decisions based on our own learning experience but also learning from others like at restaurants But how do we learn from others to better inform our own learning If they work in parallel is social learning processed differently from direct learning 215
