1598112769290563584,2022-12-01 00:32:30+00:00,418,67,In Nov 22 long term treasury rates dropped the treasury yield curve became more inverted the S amp P was up gt 5 amp the ERP dropped from 5 48 to 5 26 Investors rightly or wrongly are pricing in expectations of easing inflation amp a slowing economy
1592660418191056896,2022-11-15 23:26:48+00:00,169,13,For Facebook to turn things around it needs a plausible Metaverse business story and not only tie its investment spending to this story but also provide markers that it and investors can use to track progress towards delivering on that story
1592660414240022528,2022-11-15 23:26:47+00:00,94,2,On October 29 2022 the company's market cap was 247 billion indicating that investors were valuing Facebook's Metaverse bet at 83 billion indicating a view that all of the money that Facebook is spending on the Metaverse will be wasted

1592660405889171457,2022-11-15 23:26:45+00:00,45,1,Challenges on the privacy front and a maturing online ad business are the stressors on Facebook's business story and faced with the choice of acceptance denial and a rebirth reset Facebook has gone big on the last choice with its Metaverse bet

1592660395134976002,2022-11-15 23:26:43+00:00,97,7,A good valuation is a bridge between stories and numbers If your strength is numbers adding a story to your valuation will make it better amp more memorable If you revel in stories bringing in numbers will create more discipline in your valuation
1592660391305580544,2022-11-15 23:26:42+00:00,805,124,My third and final post on Facebook's most recent earnings report focuses on the importance of story telling in valuation and how the absence of a compelling business story to back up its Metaverse investments is hurting the company
1591451216172978176,2022-11-12 15:21:52+00:00,12,2,The comment misread what I was saying Right now the company is knocking off 100 billion for money that will be spent on Reality Labs and attaching almost no value to the cash inflows that it may create In effect that is a negative 100 billion not zero value
1590801183811448833,2022-11-10 20:18:52+00:00,181,25,Investors seem to have lost all trust in Facebook to deliver value on the Metaverse investment and I blame FB Telling the world that you plan to invest 100 billion over a decade without explaining how you plan to make money is not a great story line
1590801182033080320,2022-11-10 20:18:52+00:00,76,6,None of this is directed towards convincing you that FB is cheap or expensive The truth is that whether you find FB cheap or expensive right now rests almost entirely on how you think FB's huge investments on the Metaverse will play out
1590801180200173568,2022-11-10 20:18:51+00:00,36,3,Facebook's R amp D does not include a big chunk of the company's bet on the Metaverse and adjusting for that bet by removing the revenues and expenses associated with Reality Labs remakes Facebook's profit picture
1590801176144252928,2022-11-10 20:18:50+00:00,39,6,Capitalizing R amp D at Facebook increases income by 13 7 billion increasing operating income in the last 12 months from 35 54 billion to 49 26 billion and net income from 28 8 billion to 42 5 billion operating margin increases from 30 1 to 41 7
1590801171975135232,2022-11-10 20:18:49+00:00,39,3,Facebook not only spent a massive amount on R amp D in the last 12 months 32 billion but has also increased that spending manifold over the last five years Capitalizing R amp D creates a significant asset 53 billion and augments book equity
1590801166207971328,2022-11-10 20:18:48+00:00,28,3,Correcting for accounting mis categorizations of operating and capital expense is not nit picking It has consequences for both valuation and pricing altering your perspective on companies and changing your valuation amp pricing judgments
1590801161527136257,2022-11-10 20:18:47+00:00,30,4,When a capital expense is mis categorized as an operating expense still standard accounting practice you will skew operating amp net income down at most firms and take your biggest asset off the balance sheet amp out of book equity
1590801156078731264,2022-11-10 20:18:45+00:00,40,3,When a financing expense like leases is mis categorized as an operating expense standard accounting practice until 2019 operating income and debt at firms will be understated affecting operating margins amp ROIC
1590801149938257921,2022-11-10 20:18:44+00:00,73,7,In Accounting 101 expenses are categorized into operating capital and financing expenses and the categorization determines where these expenses show up in the financial statements and what those statements tell us about the business
1590801145437773825,2022-11-10 20:18:43+00:00,742,121,I use Facebook's most recent disappointing quarterly earnings report as an entree to a discussion of accounting inconsistencies in expensing especially on leases and R amp D and why they skew profitability return and debt measures at businesses

1588662139866451968,2022-11-04 22:39:04+00:00,118,5,As a consequence we should not be surprised to see bad managers entrenched at some tech companies with long term value destruction When management does change at these companies the change is likely to be chaotic and messy
1588662136779460611,2022-11-04 22:39:03+00:00,78,8,Ironically it is in these tech firms that we as investors have given away the rights to push for change by accepting second class voting status driven by founder worship and by the desire to be invested in the next big thing
1588662131469463552,2022-11-04 22:39:02+00:00,89,8,In companies with long life cycles time takes care of transitions but in tech companies with their compressed life cycles there will be more mismatches and they will occur sooner making corporate governance more critical at these firms
1588662126344040449,2022-11-04 22:39:01+00:00,176,20,That need for change occurs because the qualities you look for in top management will change as a company goes from start up to growth to mature to decline and a good manager at one stage may not be the right choice for the next stage
1588662122099380224,2022-11-04 22:39:00+00:00,82,6,In this first of three posts I focus on corporate governance the essence of which I believe is granting power to owners of businesses to change the management at these businesses when they believe that their interests are not being served
1588662120690089984,2022-11-04 22:39:00+00:00,902,143,Facebook last earnings report had made a bad year for the company even worse with revenues dropping and margins shrinking Its troubles are its own but its issues with corporate governance accounting inconsistencies amp narrative reset are sector wide
1588290790052139008,2022-11-03 22:03:28+00:00,8,0,That might be the story you want to tell but it is not the story in the numbers The ERP that captures current market sentiment is the LTM ERP which is up from 4 2 to almost 6 It is the combination of higher interest rates amp higher risk premiums that killing markets
1587207672650117120,2022-10-31 22:19:32+00:00,670,100,October 2022 was a reminder that market timing is fool's gold as a month that started in despair ended with the S amp P up more than 8 The implied ERP dropped from 6 21 to 5 48 and stocks are now priced to earn 9 53
1585996459328999424,2022-10-28 14:06:36+00:00,8,0,trezzi Equity Cap I also think it is reducing failure risk that is the biggest plus of using stock based compensation rather than paying cash and in my DCFs that is an explicit input My argument is not that SBC does not make sense but against adding back of SBC as if it were a free good
1585995910588166144,2022-10-28 14:04:26+00:00,8,0,trezzi Equity Cap Your first point is a good one but I fail to see how adding back SBC as a non cash expense values the optionality it should be high for young start ups and decrease with access to capital Your second point is irrelevant since you invest in a share of equity not all of equity
1585259892671012864,2022-10-26 13:19:45+00:00,2,0,Only true if you average FCFE over years not in any individual year
1585040756045393920,2022-10-25 22:48:59+00:00,180,36,If you are pricing companies I think you are better off staying with accounting earnings or EBITDA rather than using free cash flows as your scalar Free cash flows are noisier indicators of a company's financial health than its earnings
1585040751314243587,2022-10-25 22:48:58+00:00,101,16,You can compute free cash flows for explaining cash flows in a past period as the base for forecasting future free cash flows and as the scalar for pricing and arrive at different estimates for teh same company
1585040747019251712,2022-10-25 22:48:57+00:00,75,5,Every item that you need for computing FCFE in a past period is in the statement of cash flows but FCFF will need an excursion albeit short to the income statement Here is how it played out for Microsoft in the 2021 fiscal year
1585040742694936576,2022-10-25 22:48:56+00:00,97,11,Any mention of free cash flow is incomplete without mention of to whom Free Cashflows to Equity FCFE measures cash available for return to equity investors but free cash flows to the firm FCFF measures cashflows to all claim holders

1575977826875953152,2022-09-30 22:36:08+00:00,637,90,September 2022 was a brutal month with stocks and bonds down across sectors and geographies The ERP for the S amp P 500 ended at 6 21 up from 5 45 and the rate spiked to 3 82 from 3 19 Risk capital is in full retreat

1574533393890484224,2022-09-26 22:56:29+00:00,353,67,Your views are likely to be very different from mine and to encompass those differences here are my estimates of index value for different rates ERP estimates and recession effects on earnings
1574533389352198144,2022-09-26 22:56:28+00:00,207,31,I gave it my best shot knowing that I will be completely wrong in hindsight and estimated the index value to be 3516 within 5 of its traded price on September 23

1574533356510842880,2022-09-26 22:56:20+00:00,69,3,The first order effect of higher expected inflation is in higher interest rates and you are seeing those higher rates across the US treasury term structure in 2022 with bigger increases in rates at the short end
1574533351767044096,2022-09-26 22:56:19+00:00,84,3,The inflation implied in the US treasury market as the difference between the rate and the TIPs rate is also climbing albeit at a slower rate and with a strong term structure short term inflation gt long term inflation

1565110229120925696,2022-08-31 22:52:11+00:00,239,38,I am sorry but I transposed the ERP and rate in the chart for Sept 2021 The corrected figure is below and you can see that in the last year the riskfree rate rose from 1 31 to 3 19 and the ERP increased from 4 21 to 5 45
1565093774400770049,2022-08-31 21:46:48+00:00,338,54,Since inflation concerns first surfaced in early 2021 investors have under estimated its potential for damage and over estimated the Fed's powers to bring it back under control My picture from May 2022 on how this will play out in the market still holds
1565093771074625536,2022-08-31 21:46:47+00:00,149,8,To see the details of the ERP calculation and how the ERP is a composite metric that reflects investor fears amp hopes check out the spreadsheet with the Sept 2022 calculation and my website for historical perspective
1565093768629325824,2022-08-31 21:46:47+00:00,155,10,In the last few days as cracks emerged in that consensus with fresh concerns about how soft the landing will be and whether inflation will persist US stocks are down again the rate is up to 3 19 and the ERP for the S amp P 500 rose to 5 45 on 9 1 22
1565093764946833408,2022-08-31 21:46:46+00:00,889,112,For a market that was unsettled by inflation for much of this year in July and for much of August it looked like investors had reached a consensus on a soft landing for the economy amp a quick drop off in inflation allowing US stocks to recover strongly
