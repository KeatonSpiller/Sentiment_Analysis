1580965569406283779,2022-10-14 16:55:39+00:00,2,0,2020 had a huge economic contraction but was unlike traditional recessions Will we actually have a recession this time People debate that Opinions vary But I d say it is a recession that actually resets the cycle yet maybe 2020 qualifies even though very unconventional 3 4
1580965268842459140,2022-10-14 16:54:27+00:00,2,1,Then this one which I ve said repeatedly so far is reminiscent to me of 1966 a period just beyond the recall of almost everyone active in running money for work And in that it is long enough and big enough to qualify as a bear market but just barely by either standard 2 4
1580965159153020935,2022-10-14 16:54:01+00:00,1,0,Well nouns and adjectives matter 2020 officially qualified to be defined as a bear market and always will be cited as such despite it being short like a hugely oversized correction 1 4

1512462107769389058,2022-04-08 16:07:21+00:00,1,0,Hence being three months in and down this amount is both consistent with a bear market and also a correction Cute hey Thanks for following me Jason being observant and asking 7 7

1509946397444870147,2022-04-01 17:30:49+00:00,0,0,He was right the first time but just thought transitory meant quickly as opposed to several years That is the long and short of it When Nixon imposed wage and price controls that was inherently inflationary because it created supply chain snafus 8 9
