1602333198503284736,2022-12-12 16:02:59+00:00,46,2,21 When you think about this on a bigger scale you start to see how iterative the product becomes By rapidly reaching mass adoption it expands the data sample size from an input perspective enabling it to learn more which further drives use as it is proved productive

1602333192970805248,2022-12-12 16:02:57+00:00,54,1,17 While some of the prompts being input into ChatGPT are great for comedic value

1599795849286275073,2022-12-05 16:00:27+00:00,36,0,24 On one hand Apple has earned the right to charge whatever they want They manufactured marketed and distributed the single greatest consumer good arguably of all time An incredibly difficult thing to do If you don t like it go somewhere else
1599795847730204675,2022-12-05 16:00:27+00:00,32,0,23 The battle for the App Store isn t some cutesy isolated issue It is a 100s billion per year type of fight It is an important part of the distribution model in entertainment and more productivity and importantly how we interact with each other on a daily basis
1599795845871726592,2022-12-05 16:00:27+00:00,33,0,22 In a sit down interview Elon postulated that North America has no WeChat equivalent WeChat is an everything app in China that is chat social and payments all wrapped into one He thinks Twitter might be able to do this This will cause all sorts of headbutting
1599795844349595649,2022-12-05 16:00:26+00:00,32,0,21 Elon is now coming in and introducing subscription tiers 8 month verification as well as talking about building a payment layer on top of Twitter This comes from his background of building out Paypal
1599795842860187648,2022-12-05 16:00:26+00:00,33,0,20 Now it s Elon s Turn and I think this one has the potential to get very interesting The pre musk era of Twitter was so incredibly boring as there were no major changes to revenue streams and essentially no change in the underlying product
1599795841404805120,2022-12-05 16:00:26+00:00,28,1,19 Epic aimed to get the court to allow third party app stores to get apps on iOS devices but largely lost the lawsuit then appealed Apple won the antitrust suit but was ordered to allow developers to add in app links to outside websites where payments could be accepted
1599795839928479744,2022-12-05 16:00:25+00:00,25,0,18 The Games v Apple saga started in 2020 when allowed Fortnite players to make purchases directly in app skirting the in app purchase rules Apple quickly pulled the Fortnite app from the App Store and was ready with an antitrust lawsuit over the Store rules
1599795838405922821,2022-12-05 16:00:25+00:00,24,0,17 Another major contention here is the 30 take rate on IAP in app purchases Every movement needs a champion the battle against Apple has lately been led by Epic Games Fortnite CEO Tim Sweeney Fortnite is a very popular game with 80M active users on a monthly basis
1599795836854013953,2022-12-05 16:00:24+00:00,23,0,16 This led to many apps trying to circumvent the in app purchase model altogether Netflix and other entertainment apps will not let you subscribe from within the app and some have resorted to a 30 price hike on subscriptions when done within apps rather than on a website
1599795835361198081,2022-12-05 16:00:24+00:00,25,1,15 Apple has strict rules surrounding how users get content from within apps and how that benefits them Until recently Apps purchased from the App Store any in app purchase and subscriptions made within an app all had to pay a 30 cut to Apple
1599795833838321669,2022-12-05 16:00:24+00:00,27,1,14 Apps fit into a wide variety of pricing schemes Some apps are free while others feature a one time cost associated with downloads Ads support some apps and reoccurring subscription charges or other in app purchases support others
1599795832059883520,2022-12-05 16:00:23+00:00,44,1,13 As of 2022 there are more than 1 2B iPhone users and 1 6M apps available In 2022 the App store brought in 72 3B in revenue for Apple up from 38 7B in 2017 For reference Netflix did 31B in revenue over the last 12 months
1599795830428688385,2022-12-05 16:00:23+00:00,29,0,12 The App Store can best be described as a gated or closed platform with a massive install base The App Store is the only way you can get access to a wealthy cohort of end users and you have to pay the toll to make money
1599795828662861825,2022-12-05 16:00:22+00:00,24,0,11 The lower the take rate the more attractive it is to come onto to platform for the supplier the higher the take rate the higher the value capture for the platform owner Very powerful platforms can charge higher take rates These are the basic tenants of a platform
1599795826682826758,2022-12-05 16:00:22+00:00,27,1,10 Platforms derive their value from how large they can grow their user base supply and demand side and how many transactions are performed on the platform They then make their money taking a portion of this transaction as a fee rake or take rate
1599795825042825216,2022-12-05 16:00:22+00:00,29,1,9 Once you reach a frame of inertia you have to pay equal attention to curating and growing both demand and supply and the most important thing is combining high volume with a fair and modest take rate
1599795823037976576,2022-12-05 16:00:21+00:00,33,4,8 At the heart of this is the concept of the Network Effect The Field of Dreams phrase If you build it they will come comes to mind meaning you have to build out an attractive supply side product first for demand to even show up in the first place
1599795821418975236,2022-12-05 16:00:21+00:00,26,0,7 Fostering an environment that is very supplier friendly goes hand in hand with this You need to have great actors on the system selling great products that further increase demand More demand better sellers more demand better sellers and so on
1599795819859042305,2022-12-05 16:00:20+00:00,32,0,6 There is a virtuous flywheel inherently built into platform models As you aggregate demand better suppliers will come to your marketplace in order to target a very specific user base that already desires that particular solution
1599795818017345536,2022-12-05 16:00:20+00:00,38,0,5 But the concept of a platform is just a fancy way of saying marketplace An arena that connects buyers and sellers To build out a successful platform you need to have proper incentive structures to foster healthy growth of both the demand and supply side of the marketplace
1599795816415125504,2022-12-05 16:00:20+00:00,43,0,4 With the proliferation of the internet and software companies we experienced the evolution of a business model known as a platform Platforms aimed to be one stop shops where you have a landing zone of sorts with a bunch of other stuff built on top of it
1599795814401908736,2022-12-05 16:00:19+00:00,49,0,3 Yeah absolutely they made the damn thing But 30 C mon now This is due to the strength of the platform product that they have built App developers don t HAVE to go on the App Store but they should Let s start by breaking down the strength of the Platform Model
1599795812724539392,2022-12-05 16:00:19+00:00,72,0,2 Apple is the closest thing to a gatekeeper when it comes to the modern internet For ages they have been taking a cut through the app store on everyone that has generated revenue through an app on an iPhone Do they deserve a cut of every dollar generated on an iPhone
1599795810668945408,2022-12-05 16:00:18+00:00,387,31,There s no doubt Elon is the man in the arena But it looks like he s entering a new Arena and this time against a towering Goliath Apple s 30 toll on access to a massive wealthy cohort has been one of the most defensible monopolies of the modern era Can it stand

1598008496397565952,2022-11-30 17:38:09+00:00,247,11,Cohodes also argues that Silvergate having such a close relationship with FTX is a huge red flag If it didn t do its due diligence on FTX which other loans on its balance sheet are from companies that could implode

1597728429075746817,2022-11-29 23:05:16+00:00,8687,495,Sam Bankman Fried says he only has 100k left in his bank account

1597673974007070720,2022-11-29 19:28:53+00:00,478,18,SBF also has an issue with how everyone online has been dissecting his personal life He said on the call that people don t care about the true boring story and are instead wasting their time discussing if the FTX employees living in the shared Penthouse are polyamorous
1597673972304596992,2022-11-29 19:28:53+00:00,627,28,However again Sam seems to be stretching the truth to make himself look better He says that FTX customers can be made whole but he s using FTX Token FTT values from before it crashed FTX s large FTT position can t be liquidated without crashing the price further
1597673970454605827,2022-11-29 19:28:52+00:00,456,23,He says that FTX US customers will get a penny on the dollar and FTX International customers will get 20 to 25 cents on the dollar if he doesn t help anymore He implies that he could get customers a much higher amount if the trustees allowed him to help
1597673968647172096,2022-11-29 19:28:52+00:00,867,29,He also claims that he s fighting a jurisdictional battle between countries to resolve everything for customers In the call Sam paints himself as the hero trying to do the right thing but the bureaucratic establishment just won t let him Yeah okay
1597673966931709952,2022-11-29 19:28:51+00:00,489,15,And then Sam claims that he was trying to hand the 4 billion over but the trustees of the estate would rather burn it all to the ground out of shame than try to fix the situation
1597673965539201025,2022-11-29 19:28:51+00:00,579,29,Why Because 4 billion in liquidity appeared just 8 f cking minutes after FTX filed for bankruptcy
1597673964096344064,2022-11-29 19:28:51+00:00,475,22,Sam also said that filing for bankruptcy was a mistake I honest to God believe that if I hadn t filed for bankruptcy all users would be whole and withdrawals would be on
1597673962099855363,2022-11-29 19:28:50+00:00,529,25,When FTX first started customer wire transfers into the exchange went to Alameda by default just because FTX didn t have its own bank account yet Sam told Tiffany that the accounting error was caused by this arrangement that wasn t properly fixed later
1597673960505688064,2022-11-29 19:28:50+00:00,681,32,Sam said FTX s accounting systems were poorly labeled which caused him to be wrong on FTX s liabilities and assets by an embarrassingly large number But he insists that this entire fiasco was caused by lazy accounting and internal controls but not fraud
1597673958899257345,2022-11-29 19:28:49+00:00,725,38,Tiffany asked about the alleged back door that allowed SBF to take money out of FTX without anyone else at the company being alerted Sam says that s completely untrue and says that he actually doesn t know how to code or even use FTX s backend
1597673957490319360,2022-11-29 19:28:49+00:00,1367,135,He says that he intentionally made Democratic donations publicly because the media has a liberal bias and would be more favorable to him But he still made donations to Republicans in order to gain influence on both sides of the aisle
1597673955959373824,2022-11-29 19:28:49+00:00,1131,126,Sam says that the claims about him being the largest Democratic donor are misleading He claims to have donated equally to both sides but many donations to Republicans were dark money that didn t have to be disclosed
1597673953790525440,2022-11-29 19:28:48+00:00,546,22,This call was from November 16 between SBF and The entire audio was just posted on YouTube this morning Here are a few of the most interesting parts

1597313859815366657,2022-11-28 19:37:55+00:00,117,10,22 The recession is coming and it will be interest rate induced
1597313858456416256,2022-11-28 19:37:55+00:00,64,4,21 We typically see this first wave of layoffs start 12 months from the first hikes Then as it builds into a material amount of the labor force the associated reduction in consumption due to lower income itself causes other industries to do layoffs amp the effect can snowball
1597313857038716928,2022-11-28 19:37:54+00:00,45,2,20 For corporations as the cost of capital increases they will need to start protecting their bottom lines as I outlined last week by letting go of employers This is also paired with the pressure from equity markets to shorten duration in a high interest rate market
1597313855570735104,2022-11-28 19:37:54+00:00,48,4,19 As home equity turns over so does purchasing home fixtures electronics and renovation materials When consumers buy homes they are also frequently moving out of the core thus requiring a car to commute Autos sales start to drop
1597313854169829376,2022-11-28 19:37:54+00:00,48,3,18 Rents are also going up because those priced out of buying are forced to rent Everyone is getting squeezed The result is lower disposable income to spend on discretionary items
1597313852718612480,2022-11-28 19:37:53+00:00,43,2,17 paying more on a monthly basis to preserve principal repayments lower disposable income or keeping the same payments with a majority of the portion going towards interest rather than principal repayment lower equity accumulation
1597313851321913344,2022-11-28 19:37:53+00:00,32,1,16 It takes a while to reflect in price because those who thought about selling to move up are hesitant to do so because they will have to renew their mortgage at higher rates Those with variable mortgage rates are either extending their amortization
1597313848863690752,2022-11-28 19:37:52+00:00,35,1,15 Rate hikes affect borrowers ability to qualify for mortgages as the average 30yr mortgage moves with fed rates This means lower demand The White line shows the average 30yr mortgage rate while the yellow line shows the midpoint of the federal funds target rate
1597313847500898306,2022-11-28 19:37:52+00:00,37,2,14 Since the primary residence is the largest asset among households across various age groups with the exception of the 55 64 demographic changes in the value of this asset have an outsized impact on overall wealth both real and perceived
1597313845982203904,2022-11-28 19:37:52+00:00,41,1,13 This is where we are today This rapid rise in interest rates takes time to work itself through the economy typically with a 12 18 month lag The greatest consumer wealth shift going on right now is in the housing market
1597313844631973888,2022-11-28 19:37:51+00:00,44,3,12 But too much too quickly was never going to end well The morphine eventually wore off and we are now experiencing that hangover When rampant inflation started to come after this stimulus the only thing the Fed could do was raise rates to get prices back in line
1597313843222712320,2022-11-28 19:37:51+00:00,36,2,11 Then Covid cops came and abruptly broke up the party Covid ground everything to a halt and stopped the economy in its tracks The Fed had to step in They did this in a huge way by drastically increasing the money supply to backstop the falloff in economic activity
1597313841691471872,2022-11-28 19:37:51+00:00,40,4,10 During the growth cycle the Fed kept interest rates near zero for a long period The lower cost of lending spurred economic activity by forcing allocators of capital to focus on growth This crowded capital across every asset class as the bubble of everything inflated
1597313840399945728,2022-11-28 19:37:50+00:00,44,2,9 Coming back from their vacations the consumer is faced with rising inflation mortgage rates blowing through the roof and the bill at dinner after a night out hitting a lot harder than it usually does This is all due to rates
1597313838940303361,2022-11-28 19:37:50+00:00,45,4,8 As lockdowns eased the consumer shot out of the cannon as they sat on top a mountain of free money given to them by the government and spent it traveling to the Amalfi coast Now people are starting to feel the hangover from too many Negroni Sbagliato s
1597313837614903296,2022-11-28 19:37:50+00:00,49,2,7 we renovated our homes bought everything with 1 day delivery on Amazon binged on streaming services and spent way too much money on new Fortnite skins We bought more things and did less things
1597313836293705730,2022-11-28 19:37:49+00:00,46,3,6 As consumers were locked away they fired up Zoom for everything from meetings poker nights and the most depressing of them all children s birthday parties Instead of packing ourselves onto contaminated Petri dishes that are also known as cruise ships
1597313834553061378,2022-11-28 19:37:49+00:00,41,2,5 Money was cheap and fast During this time the consumer was feeling good all the time Then came desolation and despair As the lockdown ensued fundamental sea changes that would take decades to entrench happened in months
1597313833093107712,2022-11-28 19:37:49+00:00,45,3,4 Before Covid the consumer had a healthy spending mix between goods and services They did things and they bought things In this whimsical period we had historically low interest rates equity markets were rocking amp rolling and the housing market was a no lose scenario
1597313831738695681,2022-11-28 19:37:48+00:00,48,4,3 But just how strong are those affinities when other costs like mortgages are continuing to ramp While inflation makes carrying 100 of groceries much easier it also is eating significantly into the health of overall consumer spending Let s recap how we got here
1597313830258106369,2022-11-28 19:37:48+00:00,71,4,2 Someone needs to tell the consumer we re heading for a recession Americans have a near insatiable need to buy things Iconic brands Nike Apple Coke All staples in the American persona Warren Buffett calls this obsession with image a moat through brand identity
1597313828488089600,2022-11-28 19:37:48+00:00,385,52,While the cat is out of the bag on inflation it s the beast we know We can see it We can feel it There has been a narrative that some point to a silver lining in a strong job market and a strong consumer These are both about to be very wrong conclusions

1597257739121864704,2022-11-28 15:54:55+00:00,563,24,BlockFi thought it was being rescued but it just hitched itself to a different shaky creditor When the deal happened in July many believed FTX was in a strong liquidity position Turns out that wasn t the case

1597234142831575040,2022-11-28 14:21:09+00:00,119,16,Basically Alameda Research FTX s hedge fund was used as a workaround for FTX and FTX US being separate FTX US transferred funds to Alameda which then dispersed them to FTX or whichever entity FTX needed money sent to The consumer protections of FTX US were a mirage
1597234141007081472,2022-11-28 14:21:09+00:00,128,28,It appears that FTX US really wasn t a separately run entity like it should have been Alameda Research withdrew 204 million from FTX US just before filing for bankruptcy And several other FTX entities
1597234139354521602,2022-11-28 14:21:08+00:00,121,11,It seems that FTX US wanted to be the one stop shop for everything finance related Banking crypto trading and stock investing You might think FTX just tried to grow too fast in too many markets But it gets so much worse
1597234137529995265,2022-11-28 14:21:08+00:00,110,7,At the time FTX US said it would avoid Robinhood s business model of selling order flow while also not charging commissions on stock and ETF trades As I covered last week FTX was also working on creating an online bank

1597234130202554368,2022-11-28 14:21:06+00:00,142,12,FTX US had several red flags First FTX US wasn t even allowed to operate in New York State due to the strict financial regulations in the state These are regulations that smaller competitors Gemini and Coinbase were able to figure out
1597234128406999040,2022-11-28 14:21:06+00:00,143,12,FTX US and FTX were supposed to be legally separate FTX US was supposed to keep American money separately held and not intermingle it with FTX International money If they did that would basically defeat the purpose of this arrangement
1597234126826123266,2022-11-28 14:21:05+00:00,128,13,Let me first clarify what FTX US even is FTX was forced to create a separate version of its exchange to comply with US securities regulations The original FTX exchange was not allowed to operate in the US so FTX made a US compliant version FTX US
1597234125156798469,2022-11-28 14:21:05+00:00,119,11,Just a day later FTX US entered into Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Sam never again addressed his earlier comment about FTX US being fine So what went wrong

1596198857515597824,2022-11-25 17:47:18+00:00,1454,113,This is just a guess but it seems that FTX needed an established US bank with the relevant regulatory licenses to partner with on this digital banking venture
1596198855665913856,2022-11-25 17:47:17+00:00,1350,94,So it appears FTX wanted to move into the digital banking space which makes sense But why did they need to partner with such an obscure bank to make that happen Some have speculated that it was to avoid regulatory scrutiny but nothing is confirmed
1596198853816074242,2022-11-25 17:47:17+00:00,1192,100,FTX s investment valued the bank at 115 million But it only had 10 million in customer deposits The plan according to a Moonstone exec was to revamp the company into a digital focused bank
1596198852201267206,2022-11-25 17:47:16+00:00,1159,83,It appears that Moonstone and Farmington Banks are maintaining separate brands Farmington Bank is the physical location for local Farmington residents to make deposits and Moonstone is an online banking app targeted at entrepreneurs and tech savvy customers

1596175327151427584,2022-11-25 16:13:48+00:00,973,52,14 Twitter may look chaotic as Musk seeks drastic change But we could all learn something from his decisiveness
1596175325146525697,2022-11-25 16:13:47+00:00,929,49,13 Possibly he s just going to turn it around and IPO when markets recover netting a tidy profit for himself and his backers One thing s for sure though Whatever his plan maintaining a bloated headcount of inefficient employees through recession plays no part in it
1596175323053391876,2022-11-25 16:13:47+00:00,761,44,12 And what is Musk s vision for Twitter Perhaps as some Tesla investors fear he s just bored and wanted a new challenge Maybe like when Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post Musk wants the power of owning a media company
1596175321576923137,2022-11-25 16:13:46+00:00,1027,62,11 Musk wants an efficient team to run the company according to his vision No part of his plan involves a bloated headcount He wants to keep exactly the sort of people who are willing perhaps even excited to print out their code and talk about why it s important
1596175319664570369,2022-11-25 16:13:46+00:00,1145,86,10 The median salary at Twitter is 75 542 and Musk has already cut headcount by 5 000 That means roughly 350 million saved year And you can trust that Musk has kept the best of the best to work on Twitter s most important projects
1596175317269364738,2022-11-25 16:13:45+00:00,1417,84,9 Middle managers everywhere were horrified How dare Musk suggest that employees time be used efficiently and not wasted on endless meetings It seems that these are exactly the same people who are upset about Musk s cull at Twitter
1596175315553820674,2022-11-25 16:13:45+00:00,1634,122,8 Just this morning journalists rediscovered a 2018 memo written by Musk for Tesla It contained advice like Get rid of large meetings Only hold frequent meetings if working on an urgent matter Drop off a call as soon as you re no longer adding value
1596175313326985217,2022-11-25 16:13:44+00:00,1257,75,7 Now Alphabet must be watching jealously as Musk effortlessly culls Twitter s headcount He doesn t have to please any shareholders and reports of employee dissatisfaction seem to be overblown After all what engineer wouldn t want to work for the genius behind Tesla
1596175311380652032,2022-11-25 16:13:44+00:00,1278,91,6 Twitter Alphabet and the rest of the tech sector overhired Money was cheap and investors celebrated any increase in headcount as a sign of growth Engineers were employed to work out projects that had no clearly defined benefit to the company
1596175309598257152,2022-11-25 16:13:43+00:00,1061,67,5 This week Alphabet announced that it was looking to ease out 10 000 employees Rapid growth tech stocks are getting battered by high interest rates and a potentially recessionary environment Here s the problem
1596175307769536512,2022-11-25 16:13:43+00:00,1277,78,4 Obviously Musk never had the intention of reading all the code Sure enough the engineers were soon asked to shred everything they d printed But Musk had made his intentions clear You only stay at Twitter if you can prove you add something to the company
1596175305915437056,2022-11-25 16:13:43+00:00,1189,76,3 Most just laughed at the idea of engineers poring over thousands of pages of printed code just to find out the cream of the crop But others wondered what would happen to the people who hadn t submitted any code in the last 30 days And that was precisely the point
1596175304019566592,2022-11-25 16:13:42+00:00,1167,83,2 As soon as Musk took over Twitter he purged the C suite Then he turned his eyes to the rank and file Print out 50 pages of code you ve done in the last 30 days an internal message read Engineers were told their work would be reviewed by senior Tesla staff
1596175302073679872,2022-11-25 16:13:42+00:00,8112,1122,Elon Musk knows how to run a business We ve looked closely at what s going on with everyone s favorite social media site to see what his strategy really is And the chaos among Twitter s employees isn t nearly as chaotic as it seems Here s why

1595470272651575299,2022-11-23 17:32:10+00:00,162,11,Grayscale has made about 900 million since the start of 2021 from management fees on this trust So they may not want to kill the golden goose In other words they are not necessarily incentivized to change something that s working well for them
1595470271338741762,2022-11-23 17:32:09+00:00,165,11,Well maybe Here s why it might not be The market has several reasons to price GBTC below NAV including Holding GBTC is more expensive than just holding Bitcoin There s a 2 management fee and higher trading commissions because it s a trust not an ETF
1595470269547970560,2022-11-23 17:32:09+00:00,223,14,As of close yesterday GBTC is trading at a 42 73 discount to Net Asset Value NAV In other words one share of GBTC with about 14 70 in Bitcoin trades for only 8 44 So is this a huge arbitrage opportunity
1595470268134309895,2022-11-23 17:32:08+00:00,1897,196,The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust refuses to show proof of reserves due to security risks Why is this a big deal Here s why

1594773378078019587,2022-11-21 19:22:57+00:00,176,8,18 If it s the first one then customers are much more likely to get their funds back But if not then customers will have to get in the back of the line with unsecured creditors It s a tricky question that the bankruptcy court will have to figure out
1594773376828117005,2022-11-21 19:22:57+00:00,176,6,17 But it s another question entirely if that money is still around and can actually be recovered So it s complicated FTX falls into a legal gray area Customer funds aren t insured deposits So are deposits customer property or FTX property
1594773375523643392,2022-11-21 19:22:56+00:00,184,12,16 The next question will be Can the bankruptcy court clawback any of the misappropriated money For example the court may rule that Sam Bankman Fried would have to return the 3 3 billion personal loan he reportedly took from the company
1594773374303350784,2022-11-21 19:22:56+00:00,165,9,15 The first question is how much crypto and cash FTX can recover The new CEO said the records were so poorly kept that he s not even sure how much crypto the company was holding for customers But it clearly won t be enough Much of the crypto was taken or lost on trades
1594773372847722534,2022-11-21 19:22:56+00:00,203,13,14 If FTX was an FDIC or SIPC insured entity which all US banks and traditional brokerages are the US government would guarantee the deposits and everyone would get their money back But FTX is neither of those
1594773371501350928,2022-11-21 19:22:55+00:00,172,7,13 What I described above is the traditional capital stack But we re missing a huge piece Customer deposits Will customers get their money back This is a tricky question
1594773370335379457,2022-11-21 19:22:55+00:00,220,13,12 That s why we ve seen equity investors like the Ontario Teacher s Pension Fund write their 95 million investment down to 0 already They have no hope of recovering any funds
1594773369127374850,2022-11-21 19:22:55+00:00,160,7,11 We re now reaching the end of the priority list Equity holders Unfortunately for equity holders they re the last to be paid back in bankruptcy
1594773367785197586,2022-11-21 19:22:54+00:00,157,5,10 Secured means that the money loaned out was tied to a specific asset as collateral Unsecured means the money was loaned based on the credit for the company but wasn t tied to a specific asset
1594773366556266496,2022-11-21 19:22:54+00:00,202,7,9 After wages next in line to be paid back is debtholders In order of priority 1 Senior secured debt 2 Junior secured debt 3 Senior unsecured debt 4 Junior unsecured debt
1594773365281136643,2022-11-21 19:22:54+00:00,180,3,8 Clearly this isn t happening with FTX since the old leadership caused all these problems with incompetence and fraud But don t be surprised if the replacement leadership team continues to be paid well to clean up the mess
1594773363989291011,2022-11-21 19:22:54+00:00,182,6,7 In fact it s not uncommon for companies to pay retention bonuses to key executives and employees going into a bankruptcy Employees get the bonus in exchange for agreeing to stick around to see the bankruptcy through
1594773362722672646,2022-11-21 19:22:53+00:00,190,4,6 But now more than ever it s important to keep paying the employees who can get the company through bankruptcy Especially in a reorganization as opposed to liquidation the company needs to continue to operate
1594773361485574144,2022-11-21 19:22:53+00:00,211,8,5 Next is employees Staff get any unpaid wages and they ll continue to receive wages if they re working for the company during bankruptcy With FTX I saw several questions about the new CEO John Ray being paid 1 300 hour Why would they pay him that much many asked
1594773360004694018,2022-11-21 19:22:53+00:00,281,21,4 Speaking of the IRS they know how to get paid Taxes are always the highest priority in a liquidation So FTX will have to pay any outstanding federal or state taxes if they owe any
1594773358696345600,2022-11-21 19:22:52+00:00,209,9,3 Let me quickly clear up a misconception about bankruptcy The term creditor does not just mean someone who gave the bankrupt company a loan A creditor is anyone that s owed money or assets It could be an employee who s owed wages vendors or even the IRS
1594773357299437577,2022-11-21 19:22:52+00:00,228,11,2 There s a very specific order that debtors get paid back This order is determined by the Capital Stack The capital stack basically tells us the priority each creditor has in the event of liquidation or reorganization
1594773355797876743,2022-11-21 19:22:52+00:00,3384,456,FTX has just 900 million in assets to cover over 9 billion in liabilities But who gets paid back first and who isn t getting any funds back Time for a

1594722737553084416,2022-11-21 16:01:43+00:00,404,27,13 When you pair a brutal operator with a fluffy social media company you start to see how over staffed companies are This is not the fault of the software engineer or marketing or salesperson at Twitter It s the result of too much capital directed to mediocre solutions
1594722736093495296,2022-11-21 16:01:43+00:00,300,11,12 He is a brutally efficient operator making technically difficult products that further human advancement Time will tell whether he has overdone it and broken Twitter but the end result will be less excess in the system
1594722734277382144,2022-11-21 16:01:43+00:00,409,22,11 What s going on over at Twitter is a microcosm of the overall Tech space Say what you will about but he is The Man in the Arena None of us keyboard warriors have run Tesla or SpaceX

1594722729294438401,2022-11-21 16:01:41+00:00,176,6,8 A major bull narrative within Technology land has been that these companies have characteristically more flexible cost structures So if they start to see slower growth they can just cut costs in order to protect the bottom line
1594722727486787589,2022-11-21 16:01:41+00:00,309,11,7 It was also a result of excess venture capital funding and the birth of one of the worst vehicles for retail investors of all time SPACs The only people that got paid in SPACs were the crook sponsors but I digress
1594722725654073345,2022-11-21 16:01:40+00:00,357,15,6 That s 18 5 trillion in wealth created in 12 years To put that in scale the global GDP is 96T and the United States has a GDP of 23T This was all a result of capital flowing into these companies because in a low interest rate environment it had nowhere else to go

1593666308868116484,2022-11-18 18:03:51+00:00,103,6,17 Meanwhile the FBI and SEC are investigating FTX Sam Bankman Fried and other executives While the legal proceedings need to play out there s certainly a good chance that indictments are around the corner
1593666307458842625,2022-11-18 18:03:51+00:00,83,4,16 However critics point to one aspect of the Lehman collapse that was blatantly illegal A misuse of an accounting rule called Repo 105 moving 50 billion in debt off the balance sheet just in time for the quarterly earnings release
1593666306057932801,2022-11-18 18:03:50+00:00,69,2,15 It s still debated whether or not Lehman executives broke the law While the company may have been incredibly reckless with its capital it didn t collapse because of fraud
1593666304753516546,2022-11-18 18:03:50+00:00,102,8,14 Another big difference Legal troubles No one from Lehman Brothers was charged with a crime Former CEO Dick Fuld now runs a private wealth management business and is still wealthy though not nearly as much as he was before 2008
1593666303440699396,2022-11-18 18:03:50+00:00,102,5,13 In other words Lehman s assets were tied to millions of homes commercial properties and businesses all over the US FTX had billions of customer deposits but their leverage was not intertwined in real world assets like homes or businesses
1593666301951623170,2022-11-18 18:03:49+00:00,84,6,12 While Lehman was just one aspect of the 2008 Financial Crisis it contributed to trillions in lost wealth credit and economic output Meanwhile FTX s collapse is wreaking havoc in the crypto industry but is fairly contained within it
1593666300555010052,2022-11-18 18:03:49+00:00,71,2,11 What about ripple effects The most obvious for the Lehman collapse was a confidence crisis Banks stopped lending investors pulled money out of banks and funds and credit markets froze up
1593666299174985728,2022-11-18 18:03:49+00:00,81,7,10 Per the bankruptcy filing FTX liabilities are 9 1 billion which include 5 1 billion in USD balances from customers We recently learned that crypto deposits weren t properly recorded as liabilities so it may be a while before we find the true amount of deposits in FTX
1593666297627287552,2022-11-18 18:03:48+00:00,65,3,9 But FTX took in deposits from everyday consumers which Lehman an investment bank didn t they had deposits from institutions though Total deposits on FTX depends on the day you look at They went from 9 billion on November 1st to 1 billion a week later
1593666296272588800,2022-11-18 18:03:48+00:00,77,3,8 What about money lost by investors Lehman s market cap peaked at 60 billion in 2007 FTX s valuation peaked at 32 billion in early 2022
1593666294896795656,2022-11-18 18:03:48+00:00,67,4,7 While we don t know the leverage ratio for FTX Lehman had about 620 billion in leverage
1593666293466537988,2022-11-18 18:03:47+00:00,84,4,6 The exact leverage used by FTX is harder to know since we only know the positions of the company on the day of bankruptcy and nothing about the months leading up to the collapse In a tweet SBF said that FTX had about 13 billion in leverage just before the collapse
1593666291897729025,2022-11-18 18:03:47+00:00,121,10,5 For Lehman leverage is measured by the ratio of assets to owner s equity That comes out to about 31 1 for the end of 2007 This means that a 3 4 drop in all asset values could potentially wipe out 100 of the equity position which no one realized until it was too late
1593666290232827905,2022-11-18 18:03:47+00:00,103,8,4 Lehman was about 68x the size of FTX in terms of liabilities and 83x in terms of number of employees But there s another important dimension to consider Leverage
1593666288844509185,2022-11-18 18:03:46+00:00,140,15,3 Lehman Brothers was much larger than FTX Lehman 25 000 employees 639 billion in assets 613 billion in liabilities FTX 300 employees 1 billion in assets 9 billion in liabilities
1593666287388925952,2022-11-18 18:03:46+00:00,106,3,2 FTX and Lehman were founded 175 years apart Lehman started in 1844 as a general store that later turned into a commodity trading business FTX started in 2019

1593635227880095747,2022-11-18 16:00:21+00:00,102,10,18 FTX isn t just one bad apple It s not the first crypto exchange to crash and it won t be the last For as long as the systematic weaknesses remain the largest and most important companies in crypto could crash at any moment and take their customers money with them
1593635226101682188,2022-11-18 16:00:20+00:00,70,4,17 FTX was able to run unchecked because it was based in regulation light Bahamas Binance is based in Singapore SBF is allegedly facing extradition from the Bahamas to the United States where some believe he may be tried for wire fraud
1593635224797208580,2022-11-18 16:00:20+00:00,50,0,16 We still have no idea how the FTX chaos is going to wind down SBF probably hasn t fled to Argentina or Dubai as was initially rumored But we can only speculate about what legal consequences he may face including prison time
1593635223329177604,2022-11-18 16:00:20+00:00,52,0,15 Without any money it seems like SBF s effective altruism dreams are at an end But it highlights a bigger problem that emerges when crypto meets politics CZ has already had run ins with US and UK regulators
1593635222029045762,2022-11-18 16:00:19+00:00,91,3,14 SBF s idea of ethics was to make billions from crypto so he could give it away to his preferred causes Although he didn t have any ethical objections to moving a billion dollars of customer deposits via a corporate backdoor to try to cover up Alameda s trading losses
1593635220573458432,2022-11-18 16:00:19+00:00,71,3,13 SBF subscribed to an unconventional theory called effective altruism The hypothesis of effective altruism is that charity should be run by algorithms and objective maximizing functions It s the sort of ivory tower philosophy that crypto bros love
1593635218983948288,2022-11-18 16:00:19+00:00,56,0,12 There s a political edge to all of this too SBF had made some wild promises about spending his fortune to get his favored politicians into office Though he never actually coughed up the money and now will probably never get the chance to

1593635215976562690,2022-11-18 16:00:18+00:00,55,1,10 Binance didn t have direct exposure to FTT so it s safe for now It s even suggested the development of a crypto recovery fund Binance claims to hold 1 1 reserve and many see it as the rock of stability for the crypto industry
1593635214286237696,2022-11-18 16:00:18+00:00,63,2,9 SBF was still trying to raise funds even as his legal team began Chapter 11 proceedings BlockFi initially claimed it wasn t exposed to FTT token Customers who believed them and didn t withdraw their money immediately will probably never see it again
1593635212809981952,2022-11-18 16:00:17+00:00,88,8,8 Crypto prices only dropped some 20 during the crisis Crypto investors are still in denial Just like how SBF was in denial about his own failure FTX was never a functional company It was a passion project run by kids trying to change the world They failed
1593635211455209479,2022-11-18 16:00:17+00:00,62,3,7 Asset manager CoinShares held 30 million in FTT tokens Gemini the exchange owned by the Winklevoss brothers had 175 million in assets tied up with FTX Crypto broker Genesis suspended withdrawals and revealed it had 175 million in exposure to FTX
1593635210066796544,2022-11-18 16:00:17+00:00,71,2,6 Just two days ago crypto lender BlockFi froze customer withdrawals and prepared for bankruptcy BlockFi held 3 9 billion in client assets in the second quarter this year Crypto lender Celsius had about 13 million in under collateralized loans to Alameda
1593635208691073024,2022-11-18 16:00:16+00:00,54,2,5 Last Friday FTX and Alameda began Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings Former CEO Sam Bankman Friend who had been called the J P Morgan of crypto officially lost his billionaire status But the chaos doesn t stop there
1593635207340589056,2022-11-18 16:00:16+00:00,65,1,4 Then Binance said it might buy FTX but pulled out once they saw the 8 billion black hole in the FTX balance sheet To top it off the SEC and DOJ launched an investigation into securities law violations at FTX
1593635205792890881,2022-11-18 16:00:16+00:00,66,1,3 It turns out that Alameda was overexposed to FTX s own token FTT Then the snowball effect took hold Binance CEO CZ sold his FTT triggering a selloff FTT prices fell Alameda s balance sheet tanked investors lost trust in FTX driving FTT ever further down

1592190609820979200,2022-11-14 16:19:57+00:00,15,1,23 At the end of the month for paid subscribers I will parse through recent stats and charts that could provide clues to this all important indicator Are we finally going to start to see some disinflation or dare I say it deflation Become a paid subscriber to find out
1592190608503865348,2022-11-14 16:19:57+00:00,18,1,22 If we can establish a trend of weakening financial conditions lower inflation and a soft job market this would ultimately lend credence to the pivot narrative that some optimists falsely expected in the last FOMC meeting
1592190607224864768,2022-11-14 16:19:56+00:00,16,1,21 These data points are extremely important to market moves But one data point does not highlight a trend This makes the next CPI print that we get in December even more important
1592190605731430401,2022-11-14 16:19:56+00:00,11,1,20 The notable change also takes place around the end of the curve after the CPI print This directly flies in the face of the higher for longer narrative and implies that we are closer to the end of the hiking cycle than we thought before the print
1592190603882033155,2022-11-14 16:19:56+00:00,14,4,19 This is the curve after the print This curve tries to answer the previous question I posed what happens after the December hike Before the print the odds were in favour of another 50bps but now the market is pricing closer to a 25bps hike next
1592190602367700999,2022-11-14 16:19:55+00:00,14,3,18 A hike of 50bps at the next meeting was largely the consensus view with a high possibility but this is now essentially a lock Where this starts to get interesting is looking further out on the hiking curve As of Monday
1592190601042497536,2022-11-14 16:19:55+00:00,14,2,17 Keep an eye on the 10yr on Monday Elevated yields have been hammering high growth technology stocks as the longest duration part of the risky equity market There s no wonder the NASDAQ 100 had its best one day performance since March 2020 up 7 5 in one session
1592190599465242624,2022-11-14 16:19:55+00:00,12,2,16 One of the biggest moves in the market was the US 10yr as yields fell off a cliff down from 4 2 last week to 3 8 as of Thursday s close Growth continued to rally again on Friday and the dollar fell off further but the bond market was closed due to Veterans Day
1592190598119030784,2022-11-14 16:19:54+00:00,13,1,15 2 Excluding shelter the core index declined 0 1 This is one of the softer numbers reported in recent decades Core goods prices were soft with a 0 4 decline and some of the factors that boosted inflation over the past year have started to either downshift or reverse
1592190596663640064,2022-11-14 16:19:54+00:00,13,1,14 Given the lag between the CPI s rent measures and some related industry figures this could continue to be firm into next year However we are in a period of historically high mortgage rates and we know what is coming here when the index catches up with reality
1592190594734239746,2022-11-14 16:19:53+00:00,13,1,13 Breaking down by subsector there were 2 main stories when looking at core inflation 1 Rent and shelter more broadly remained firm The shelter aggregate rose 0 8 in October with tenants rent up 0 7 owners equivalent rent up 0 6 and lodging prices up 4 9
1592190593152815110,2022-11-14 16:19:53+00:00,11,1,12 Then came the numbers Headline CPI YoY consensus was 7 9 and actual was 7 7 MoM consensus was 0 6 and actual was 0 4 Core CPI Headline ex food and energy YoY consensus was 6 5 and actual was 6 3 MoM consensus was 0 5 and actual was 0 3
1592190591827578880,2022-11-14 16:19:53+00:00,13,1,11 Heading into CPI it was a common view that the Fed would need to see sufficient progress on inflation to pause at 4 75 in February but the risks were skewed to more hikes that will likely bring a recession sometime later in 2023 or early 2024
1592190590426517504,2022-11-14 16:19:52+00:00,15,1,10 Powell also acknowledged that the odds of a soft landing have narrowed The hawkish tone is consistent with a macroeconomy that continues to run hot with repeated upside surprises to inflation and labor markets
1592190589113860097,2022-11-14 16:19:52+00:00,14,1,9 Chair Powell stated that rates are likely to move higher than previously indicated by the September dots 4 75 and more importantly remain there for longer than previously expected
1592190587692019712,2022-11-14 16:19:52+00:00,15,1,8 After this meeting the market widely anticipated the forward meetings to hike 50bps in December and another 25bps in the first meeting of the new year The question on the top of everyone s mind was what will the Fed do after these two hikes
1592190585972080640,2022-11-14 16:19:51+00:00,15,2,7 Going into the print the Fed hiked rates 75bps at the November meeting bumping up the target range to 3 75 4 0 Without committing the FOMC opened the door to slowing the pace of hikes at the next meeting but signaled that it is not close to pausing the tightening cycle
1592190584122658817,2022-11-14 16:19:51+00:00,29,2,6 Here s a heatmap since the beginning of 2021 in terms of expectations vs actuals with green indicating lower than expected inflation and red indicating higher There are only 3 instances where the actual inflation reading has come below expectations

1588546651831955456,2022-11-04 15:00:10+00:00,10,0,12 Despite the chaotic nature of the acquisition Musk seems to be taking things slowly as the owner and head of Twitter But when the world s richest entrepreneur takes over a company you can be sure to see long term changes
1588546649827119106,2022-11-04 15:00:09+00:00,22,2,11 In China people basically live on WeChat Musk explained He wants to create something similar in America Twitter could become a super app that combines social media and messaging with a payment platform
1588546647776063488,2022-11-04 15:00:09+00:00,9,1,10 In fact China may be the inspiration for Musk s ultimate ambition with Twitter He wants to create X an everything app And owning Twitter is an accelerant to bringing that vision into reality
1588546645779976192,2022-11-04 15:00:08+00:00,8,0,9 But Vine was shut down in 2016 due to competition from Instagram Now TikTok is king of the short form video Musk might be eying up a competition with the Chinese social media giant
1588546643401773057,2022-11-04 15:00:08+00:00,10,1,8 On Monday Musk gathered a team of engineers to revive the video app Vine Twitter bought Vine for 30 million in 2012 before it was even functional By the end of 2015 Vine had 200 million active users
1588546641111707650,2022-11-04 15:00:07+00:00,9,1,7 Last week Tesla rival General Motors vocally suspended advertising on Twitter But Musk seems unconcerned after all one of his goals is to reduce Twitter s reliance on advertising Plus he may have his eyes on something bigger
1588546639165534209,2022-11-04 15:00:07+00:00,5,1,6 Nu Wexler a former Twitter exec warned that blue tick changes could make it harder to spot disinformation IPG one of the world s biggest advertising companies advised its clients to suspend Twitter adverts citing trust and safety concerns
1588546636963512321,2022-11-04 15:00:06+00:00,5,0,5 Musk s changes haven t been warmly accepted by everyone There was outrage at initial reports that the blue tick would cost 20 month While author Stephen King said that Twitter should pay him for using their platform
1588546633981362176,2022-11-04 15:00:05+00:00,8,1,4 But Musk already has monetization plans Twitter will start charging users 8 month for a blue tick on verified accounts There are currently about 400 000 users on Twitter three quarters of which have blue ticks That means a potential income of 29 MILLION year
1588546631498334209,2022-11-04 15:00:05+00:00,9,0,3 So now Musk is CEO himself His first priority is forming a content moderation council When asked whether Donald Trump would be allowed back on Twitter Musk replied that if he had a dollar for every time he was asked that question Twitter would be profitable at last
1588546629128585219,2022-11-04 15:00:04+00:00,8,1,2 A lot has happened already After appearing in Twitter HQ with a porcelain sink let that sink in Musk fired CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal They re probably going to get a combined 122 million severance payout unless Musk can prove he terminated them for cause

1584560194637688832,2022-10-24 14:59:24+00:00,11,0,18 So let s wrap up with a bull case bear case analysis
1584560190451777536,2022-10-24 14:59:23+00:00,8,0,17 If a recessionary period proceeds the lending environment will continue to erode and this increase in the spread will fail to make up for the drastic drop off in volume As goes the strength of the underlying consumer and business clients so goes the health of the banks
1584560188144898049,2022-10-24 14:59:23+00:00,7,0,16 In order to fight inflation a lot of central banks are raising rates rapidly When interest rates are increased too much too quickly borrowing demand starts to suffer and we start to experience a retreat in both new loans and refinancing volume
1584560186240692225,2022-10-24 14:59:22+00:00,8,0,15 When rates rise this spread increases with extra income going straight to earnings A rising rate environment generally means a growing economy But let s think about why rates are skyrocketing this time and the impact on a potential hard landing
1584560184193871873,2022-10-24 14:59:22+00:00,7,0,14 Banks make a spread by lending out at a higher interest rate than they pay out to customers They profit off of the marginal difference between the yield they generate with this cash invested in short term notes and the interest they pay out to customers
1584560182365155328,2022-10-24 14:59:21+00:00,6,0,13 Banks often hold large balances of cash through customer deposits and business activities Increases in the interest rate directly increase the yield on this cash dropping the proceeds to the bottom line
1584560180347273216,2022-10-24 14:59:21+00:00,5,0,12 So with all this going on let s shift to macro what do rising rates mean for banks There is a little bit of a double edged sword when it comes to thinking about how the current rate hiking environment affects banks

1583473214545883136,2022-10-21 15:00:08+00:00,29,0,15 The takeaway is that markets crash and markets rebound Right now the outlook is bleak But if there s anything to learn from Volcker it s that the darkest hour comes before the dawn
1583473212419354624,2022-10-21 15:00:08+00:00,20,0,14 So if Powell wants to get inflation under control that might mean tanking the economy Although there is good news Inflation isn t nearly as bad as it was in the 1980s and some factors are already showing signs of easing
1583473209990529024,2022-10-21 15:00:07+00:00,22,1,13 By the end of Volcker s tenure as Fed chair inflation was all the way down to 3 And the stock market regained its losses in a matter of months Check out this video to find out more about how he did it
1583473207830798336,2022-10-21 15:00:06+00:00,17,1,12 Volcker hiked the fund rate from about 5 all the way to 20 He drove the U S economy into a recession TWICE But the success of his policy was indisputable
1583473205531987968,2022-10-21 15:00:06+00:00,11,0,11 So if the Fed wants to tame inflation it might have to hike rates all the way to 8 or beyond Remember I said that inflation hit double digits in the 1980s Here s how Volcker dealt with that
1583473203263213568,2022-10-21 15:00:05+00:00,24,1,10 Once inflation gets above 5 it s never come down unless fed funds have gotten above the CPI Right now the Fed Fund rate is 3 3 25 with another 0 75 hike expected in November Meanwhile CPI sits at 8 2
1583473200960532481,2022-10-21 15:00:05+00:00,17,0,9 When you make a mistake you got to admit you re wrong and move on that nine or 10 months that they just sat there and bought 120 billion in bonds Now Druckenmiller thinks that the Fed will have to tank the economy to prevent runaway inflation
1583473198750105600,2022-10-21 15:00:04+00:00,22,0,8 Druckenmiller believes the bull market of recent years was built on low rates and quantitative easing And the Fed Reserve under chairman Jerome Powell was too slow to respond to inflation They pedaled a ridiculous theory of transitory instead of acting decisively
1583473196573290500,2022-10-21 15:00:04+00:00,19,0,7 Right now Druckenmiller isn t happy with the state of the U S economy I will be stunned if we don t have recession in 23 And he expects it to be a large one with a long lasting impact I don t rule out something really bad
1583473194476113921,2022-10-21 15:00:03+00:00,13,0,6 Stanley Druckenmiller is the billionaire investor who once managed Quantum Fund He helped George Soros to structure his legendary 10 billion bet against the Sterling in 1992 Druckenmiller knows a fair bit about reading chaotic markets
1583473191951175681,2022-10-21 15:00:03+00:00,11,0,5 That all sounds a lot like today Markets are falling and while inflation hasn t quite high 1980s highs it might be getting close Even one of the world s most legendary investors is getting worried
1583473189606211584,2022-10-21 15:00:02+00:00,11,0,4 America had never before experienced such sustained inflation Nobody knew what to do about it The stock market crashed 28 39

1582023726031581184,2022-10-17 15:00:23+00:00,15,1,15 It seems like the market is still trying to determine just how deep and long this bear market will be The main takeaway I will say from this is that the market never bottoms during a rate hiking cycle

1580943710636105728,2022-10-14 15:28:47+00:00,58,5,12 So core inflation might be coming down when the Fed hikes rates but that might not calm down the household market chaos Markets believe the inflation crisis is coming to an end They might not be prepared for the ensuing housing crisis
1580943707171274753,2022-10-14 15:28:46+00:00,36,2,11 One last thought One of the strongest contributors to yesterday s CPI print was housing Rent rose by 0 8 OER owner s equivalent rent a rent tracking metric for people who own their own home rose by 0 8 its highest since the 90s
1580943704428142592,2022-10-14 15:28:46+00:00,50,4,10 The chaos of last year s inflationary spike is starting to calm There s no doubt we re still seeing rising prices but it s manageable Another Fed rate hike alongside more stability in energy markets and this whole nightmare could be over sooner than you think
1580943701035339776,2022-10-14 15:28:45+00:00,32,1,9 Remember what the lead cause of the 2021 inflation spike was Here s a graph of used car prices to remind you But now we re starting to see a reversal of the used goods boom that was sparked by the supply chain crisis of late 2021
1580943688963788801,2022-10-14 15:28:42+00:00,28,1,8 Now let s look at what s actually driving prices Food was up 0 8 in September New goods prices rose by 0 7 But used goods fell by 1 1 So there s something more complicated than an across the board price spike
1580943686183288832,2022-10-14 15:28:41+00:00,57,1,7 In fact on a month to month scale CPI rose only 0 4 in September and just 0 1 in August Yesterday s numbers are equivalent to a 4 7 annual rise much closer to the Fed s 2 target In fact the three month average annualized inflation rate is almost exactly 2
1580943683389894657,2022-10-14 15:28:41+00:00,37,2,6 CPI is a backward looking measure The 8 2 figure is how much prices have risen since September 2021 a very long time ago Since then we ve had a supply chain crisis a war an energy blackout in Europe and maybe a recession

1580943677148450817,2022-10-14 15:28:39+00:00,33,2,4 The Dow Jones mounted one of its largest one day turnarounds ever driven by bank energy and tech stocks The rally was partially driven by the view that higher numbers in September mean inflation is peaking Traders might also have been covering short positions
1580943674296324096,2022-10-14 15:28:39+00:00,32,1,3 But that s not the full picture and markets know it In fact after the S amp P500 sunk to 3520 well below its 3600 resistance levels it mounted a midday rally ended the session up with a 2 6 gain and up 4 8 from morning lows
1580943670290763776,2022-10-14 15:28:38+00:00,34,2,2 Headline inflation was 8 2 in the year through September The numbers aren t looking good

1579497729310732288,2022-10-10 15:42:58+00:00,22,0,11 While I m not saying any of these companies will trade back up at 40x EV Revenue any time soon I am saying they don t need to Some of these companies are mission critical category killers that absolutely dominate the niche that they operate in Enough is enough
1579497727310041089,2022-10-10 15:42:58+00:00,15,0,10 You can see an absolute collapse in the high growth blue line as sentiment was completely washed out amongst this cohort It s tough to pull that chart back further to look at different cycles because most of these companies weren t even around back then
1579497724621512705,2022-10-10 15:42:57+00:00,25,0,9 However this multiple has absolutely collapsed s chart baskets high growth software companies into high 30 medium 15 30 and low under 15 baskets based on projected NTM revenue numbers

1579497713070374914,2022-10-10 15:42:55+00:00,40,0,6 SHIPPING Key to the inflation narrative was that the cost of shipping was increasing the pass through price of everything as exporters face entire ports shut down from Covid and rising fuel costs We are now seeing shipping container costs fall off a cliff

1578399819562946563,2022-10-07 15:00:16+00:00,13,0,12 For sure Credit Suisse is going to face some short term pain if it restructures for future growth But that s far from the systematic meltdown that brought down Lehman Brothers So for now you can still rely on Swiss stability
1578399817813852161,2022-10-07 15:00:16+00:00,10,0,11 Ultimately there s a big difference between a struggling company and a financial crisis Investors are confusing steeply falling equity with default risk according to CDS King Boaz Weinstein High CDS spreads don t mean that catastrophe is coming
1578399816207532032,2022-10-07 15:00:16+00:00,7,0,10 There s also a matter of perspective In 2011 Goldman Sachs s CDS spreads were double what Credit Suisse s are today And now GS is one of the largest banks in the world
1578399813841952770,2022-10-07 15:00:15+00:00,7,0,9 Lehman s high risk investments were so convoluted that they couldn t even work out how much money they needed to save the bank much less beg the Fed Reserve for that money Meanwhile Credit Suisse can likely rely on Swiss regulators to step in quickly if there is a crisis
1578399811128131593,2022-10-07 15:00:14+00:00,5,0,8 Credit Suisse has 98bn of reserves to burn through before operations are at risk And an executive claims that they ve learned from the mistakes of the past UBS burnt through billions in the financial crisis and got bailed out This is not Credit Suisse today
1578399809395986433,2022-10-07 15:00:14+00:00,5,0,7 The good news is Credit Suisse isn t likely to cause the crash of the global financial system There are a couple of reasons for this Firstly capital structures are far less risky than they were in 2008
1578399807466573827,2022-10-07 15:00:14+00:00,7,0,6 5 year CDS spreads an instrument to insure against Credit Suisse s corporate bonds have soared by 100 basis points peaking at almost 350bps Investors aren t the only ones panicking A junior Credit Suisse analyst tweeted It s honestly a bit scary
1578399805444964358,2022-10-07 15:00:13+00:00,6,0,5 Hence the current fears A Swiss bank managing 1 5 trillion in assets is facing restructuring costs that are 40 as large as its entire market capitalization This is starting to sound ominous Markets have responded to this fear
1578399803641368577,2022-10-07 15:00:13+00:00,6,0,4 Hence the scale back of operations which Credit Suisse says will save 1 5bn p a But that comes with upfront costs Analysts at Deutsche estimated that Credit Suisse needs to find 4bn in the short term to cover restructuring costs including bolstering non IB businesses
1578399801783341056,2022-10-07 15:00:12+00:00,4,0,3 According to insiders Credit Suisse is desperate to find capital without turning to the markets Its shares are down 58 this year to their lowest level in three decades And a series of credit downgrades have hampered its ability to raise funds
1578399799732207623,2022-10-07 15:00:12+00:00,9,0,2 First of all let s look at what s gone wrong It started back in the summer when Credit Suisse announced that it would cut back its investment banking branch and resurrect its bad bank for risky holdings The changes are all about cutting capital commitment
1578399797593120781,2022-10-07 15:00:11+00:00,77,7,It s been a bad week for Credit Suisse But is it bad enough to tank the global economy Here s why Credit Suisse is NOT the next Lehman Brothers Time for a

1576952453123411969,2022-10-03 15:08:57+00:00,11,0,19 When narratives get out of hand and the free market takes over its comforting to have monetary policy come to the rescue But how often can this keep happening
1576952451244392449,2022-10-03 15:08:57+00:00,7,0,18 2 The second issue is how intertwined and dependent upon each other fiscal and monetary policy have become It s clear the taxation and energy focused bill from Truss rocked the bond market because of the narrative that it told
1576952449381781504,2022-10-03 15:08:56+00:00,8,0,17 Long term rates affect everything from mortgages for individual consumers all the way to the cost of borrowing for businesses which further stymies growth This is a serious issue with long reaching implications rather than just a blip on a bloomberg screen
1576952447532089344,2022-10-03 15:08:56+00:00,9,0,16 However there are two concerns here 1 The first is the fragility of certain components of our financial system Nothing works in isolation and markets may not be ready for such rapid moves in interest rates especially systems that take a leveraged approach to LDI
1576952445674336256,2022-10-03 15:08:56+00:00,10,0,15 The BoE kicked off the plan on Wed afternoon by purchasing just over 1B of securities maturing in 20 years or more Operations will continue every weekday until Oct 14 and after yesterday s auction we could see around 61B in buying This operation has so far worked
1576952443597774848,2022-10-03 15:08:55+00:00,11,0,14 The BoE had to enforce an emergency intervention by pledging unlimited purchases of long dated bonds They had to absorb the other side of the trade in this massive sell off or else bond prices would ve collapsed further spiking yields
1576952441492279296,2022-10-03 15:08:55+00:00,10,0,13 This would ve created a spiral whereby more and more collateral would be needed as rates further spiked forcing more liquidation causing a further spike in rates and you get the picture So in stepped the BoE
1576952439499988993,2022-10-03 15:08:54+00:00,11,0,12 When long term interest rates jumped one side of these swaps collapsed in value forcing UK funds to post additional cash collateral To do that the funds had to liquidate assets that they own outright The assets Gilts
1576952436916293632,2022-10-03 15:08:53+00:00,10,0,11 Unfortunately they didn t see such a rapid move in interest rates coming Pension funds had a buffer to finance rates going up 1 25 but they were not prepared for what happened this year The 25 year gilt spiked to 5 02 on Monday after being only 3 7 the week before
1576952432546172929,2022-10-03 15:08:52+00:00,10,0,10 To make up for these very low returns they leveraged LDI buying bonds and interest rate derivatives swaps So the funds could have say 30 of their portfolio in fixed income and put the rest into growth assets while claiming to be fully hedged
1576952430566072322,2022-10-03 15:08:52+00:00,8,0,9 The problem with LDI lately is that interest rates have been very low This means that the liabilities that they held got larger while the fixed income securities they held gilts also had very low returns
1576952428728983552,2022-10-03 15:08:52+00:00,11,0,8 Pension funds in the UK own approximately 1 5 trillion in assets and about 20 of these assets are held in direct gilts UK s version of US Treasuries As of this spring pensions owned 28 of outstanding UK debt weighted more towards the long end of the curve
1576952425692307458,2022-10-03 15:08:51+00:00,14,0,7 The acronym of the day is LDI Liability Driven Investment where pension funds calculate the duration of their future obligations and then hold fixed income assets that have the same duration This means typically pensions are a large buyer of government debt
1576952421070143488,2022-10-03 15:08:50+00:00,11,0,6 Pension Funds played a role in the sell off Pension funds need to match the obligations they are required to pay out with the contributions they take in from the existing workforce But contributions taken in don t just sit in a checking account that money earns a return
1576952418637877250,2022-10-03 15:08:49+00:00,12,0,5 However this fueled concerns that inflation and borrowing would surge at a time of already rapidly rising interest rates triggering a cross asset selloff so severe that it sent the pound to a record low Cue temporary mayhem
1576952413860220928,2022-10-03 15:08:48+00:00,8,0,4 The government estimates the tax cuts will total 45B by 2026 27 on top of an energy support package that is expected to cost more than 100B over 2 years The intention is to help residents deal with higher energy prices and to boost growth via tax cuts and supply measures
1576952411088130048,2022-10-03 15:08:47+00:00,9,0,3 On the previous Friday Sept 23 under new PM Liz Truss the UK s new finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng put forward a mini budget that outlines a plan to grow the economy by cutting taxes and sharply increasing government borrowing Among the highlights
1576952406151024642,2022-10-03 15:08:46+00:00,17,0,2 While some are calling recent Fed actions a policy error over in the UK we are seeing questionable decisions on the fiscal side of the equation as the government put forward tax cuts Talking heads and even the IMF were quick to condemn these decisions
1576952404011933696,2022-10-03 15:08:46+00:00,110,14,Last week there was absolute MAYHEM in the currency markets Is this a sign of structural failure For once we got to talk about a different country s central bank The British Pound going haywire taught us several things so let s dive in Time for a

1574413537568784384,2022-09-26 15:00:13+00:00,6,1,17 Everything in the economy happens in cycles As the credit market expands amp contracts the stock market over amp undershoots these movements We have been binging on a period of low rates for far too long which has caused a lot of asset bubbles Corrections are normal
1574413535370674177,2022-09-26 15:00:12+00:00,11,1,16 Buyers aren t buying because a There isn t much inventory due to the above b They can t qualify for a mortgage at the higher rates and if they can again it will be highly unaffordable This isn t rocket surgery and Powell understands this
1574413531180863489,2022-09-26 15:00:11+00:00,11,0,15 Sellers don t want to sell because a They would record a loss 20 25 if measured from Feb 2022 highs b They ve locked in such a low fixed rate that purchasing a new home at the current higher fixed rate would be extremely unaffordable
1574413529054068736,2022-09-26 15:00:11+00:00,16,0,14 As I ve written extensively in the past something has to give with the housing market Affordability has fallen off a cliff and housing prices have not yet fully moved to reflect this There is paralysis on both sides so we can t get a proper dataset h t
1574413524910096386,2022-09-26 15:00:10+00:00,7,0,13 Without unemployment rising and inflation falling the Fed will remain firmly on the hawkish gas pedal These are the two most important things
1574413523207462912,2022-09-26 15:00:09+00:00,6,0,12 The increase on its own is unremarkable but the fact that this number has risen AND the assumption for hikes has come up means that the Fed now views supply chain problems as enduring longer than anticipated
1574413521399562240,2022-09-26 15:00:09+00:00,6,0,11 The main culprit behind the hawkish rhetoric is stickier inflation than anticipated When we look at core PCE it removes price and energy which can have massive swings When we look at projections core PCE is now seen at 3 1 in Q4 23 up from 2 7 as predicted in June
1574413519738572801,2022-09-26 15:00:08+00:00,4,0,10 The Fed is currently uneasy about the limited impact that its tightening has had on the labour market but the median estimate has the unemployment rate rising to 4 4 up from 50bps in June as growth slows to 0 2 this year and settles at 1 2 next year
1574413517926563841,2022-09-26 15:00:08+00:00,7,0,9 We know that the Fed has a dual mandate Prices inflation and Jobs employment While the rhetoric for the better part of six months has been that jobs are strong we are starting to see cracks in the jobs market and Powell told us to brace for this to accelerate
1574413516064567296,2022-09-26 15:00:08+00:00,6,0,8 This means that the Fed Fund range by the end of the year moved from 3 25 3 50 to 4 25 4 50 From current levels of 3 00 3 25 this implies another 75bps in November 50bps in December and another 50bps more in 2023 Conclusion Faster Higher Longer

1574413499924910080,2022-09-26 15:00:04+00:00,8,1,3 It looks like a mythical soft landing is no longer in the cards as Powell expressed that the more restrictive monetary policy is and the longer it stays there the higher the probability of recession
1574413494664953857,2022-09-26 15:00:02+00:00,9,0,2 Although equities briefly rallied on the back of a widely priced in 75 bps hike they finished the day and the following trading sessions as they should ve sharply down More hawkish rhetoric and shifting goalposts are the reason
1574413492635009029,2022-09-26 15:00:02+00:00,85,7,In today s market the Fed meeting is rightfully the most highly anticipated event It sets the tone for how those in charge will control the thermostat of the economy Temperature check Dad on a budget vibes Rate hikes faster higher longer What does this mean

1568260857766838272,2022-09-09 15:31:40+00:00,15,0,11 The most important lesson here is patience In the short term compounding is slow You d be tempted to just take the 1 000 cash in hand But in the long term compounding is unrivaled at building massive wealth
1568260855573221382,2022-09-09 15:31:39+00:00,7,0,10 Theoretical physicists use a special kind of compounding in Schr dinger s equation the formula that describes the fundamental workings of the universe So if this formula is good enough for the world s greatest minds then every investor should definitely learn it
1568260852935172096,2022-09-09 15:31:38+00:00,11,0,9 These are the margins that separate the top 1 of investors from the rest So how do you actually calculate your compounding returns The formula is Compound Return over N Years 1 Annual Rate 100 N Einstein had good reason to be interested in this formula
1568260849202253831,2022-09-09 15:31:37+00:00,9,0,8 Let s say you can increase your returns to 11 Since this is a 10 increase in your returns you might expect that your compounded returns will also increase by 10 to about 67 But in fact your five year compounded returns at 11 will be 68 5
1568260845469147142,2022-09-09 15:31:37+00:00,9,0,7 These are very extreme examples But compounding matters to every investor Let s say you re investing at 10 returns p a You might expect that after 5 years your investment will be up by 50 But thanks to the compounding effect it will actually be up 61
1568260842839212032,2022-09-09 15:31:36+00:00,8,0,6 Let s see where you d be at after just two weeks The 1 000 doubling 30 times would be worth 1 07 trillion And the 1 cent tripling 30 times would be worth 2 06 trillion
1568260840683438084,2022-09-09 15:31:35+00:00,6,0,5 Having seen how quickly your money doubled in the last example many would pick the first option After the first day it would double to 2 000 a gain of 1 000 immediately While the 1 cent would triple to just 3 cents But in compounding patience is key
1568260838397513740,2022-09-09 15:31:35+00:00,8,0,4 Now you see how powerful compounding is But do you know how important the compound rate is Here s another example This time you ve given the choice between 1 000 that doubles every day 1 cent that triples every day
1568260836547825666,2022-09-09 15:31:34+00:00,9,0,3 After one day the person who took the 1 000 is still 999 98 better off But with some patience the compound effect comes into full force After a month the 1 cent coin has doubled 30 times Now it s worth 10 7 MILLION
1568260834568069120,2022-09-09 15:31:34+00:00,10,1,2 Here s an example Imagine you re given the choice between taking 1 000 cash in hand or putting 1 cent into an account that doubles its value every day You d probably take the 1 000 but you d be wrong

1567528262275895298,2022-09-07 15:00:35+00:00,7,1,19 Though there might be a duration mismatch in the type of assets demanded an actual withdrawal of liquidity is not the problem For a more in depth dive into this aspect of the mechanics check out this Bloomberg article
1567528259528572928,2022-09-07 15:00:34+00:00,4,0,18 demanded by the institutions engaging in reverse repos it could sell an amount equal to the total reverse repo balance to these institutions thereby reducing the need for reverse repos and eliciting no change in the financial or real economy
1567528256756129792,2022-09-07 15:00:34+00:00,4,0,17 demanded by the institutions engaging in reverse repos
1567528254071869442,2022-09-07 15:00:33+00:00,5,0,16 While there is worry about the impact that a scheduled increase in QT could have on stock prices the unique situation with the large reverse repo balance could mute any potential effect If the Fed had securities on its balance sheet that matched the maturity profile
1567528251353874433,2022-09-07 15:00:33+00:00,8,0,15 Just as quantitative easing drove down rates we can expect QT to put upward pressure on them now as liquidity is removed from the system HOWEVER
1567528248472440834,2022-09-07 15:00:32+00:00,10,1,14 The runoff will increase the scarce bill supply that has been forcing investors into the Fed s reverse repo program which is currently at an unprecedented 2 4 trillion BofA strategists are estimating the unwinding could ultimately knock 7 of the S amp P 500 next year
1567528245595103235,2022-09-07 15:00:31+00:00,10,0,13 And now it s time for QT This month the central bank will let 95 billion in Treasuries and mortgage backed securities mature which is nearly double the peak rate of 50 billion the last time quantitative tightening was in effect from 2017 2019
1567528242403332096,2022-09-07 15:00:30+00:00,13,1,12 Overall as shown in the Federal Reserve System assets graph securities holdings more than doubled from about 3 9 trillion in early March 2020 to 8 5 trillion in May 2022 As a percent of GDP the holdings rose from 18 to 35
1567528237160341505,2022-09-07 15:00:29+00:00,8,1,11 The Fed relaunched QE in response to the economic crisis caused by Covid Policymakers announced plans for QE in March 2020 but without a dollar or time limit Over this period of QE the monthly pace of purchases was 80B for Treasury securities and 40B for agency MBS
1567528234262183937,2022-09-07 15:00:28+00:00,8,1,10 While the effects of QE were widely considered as a massive bailout of the too big to fail banks the long lasting impacts of QE are really yet to be realized with a lot of polarizing opinions And we just did it again over Covid
1567528231321960448,2022-09-07 15:00:28+00:00,8,0,9 QE got more headlines in North America during the housing collapse and GFC of 2008 In three different rounds between 2007 and 2017 the Fed s assets increased from 882 billion to 4 473 trillion
1567528227987398656,2022-09-07 15:00:27+00:00,13,0,8 QE first began in Japan when it fell into a recession in 1985 As a result it unleashed a massive stimulus program creating a stock market amp real estate bubble When it imploded in 1992 Japan was forced to bail out its financial system This sounds oddly foreshadowing
1567528225093419009,2022-09-07 15:00:26+00:00,13,1,7 Quantitative Tightening is when the Fed receives principal repayments from its Treasury holdings but does not roll them over into newly issued Treasuries Instead the Fed takes the proceeds and simply extinguishes them
1567528219686871047,2022-09-07 15:00:25+00:00,12,2,6 Time to get technical QE is when the Fed and other central banks are buying government bonds but not directly from the Treasury Department They re buying government bonds from banks and paying for them with central bank reserves
1567528214200832002,2022-09-07 15:00:24+00:00,12,0,5 On the other hand they can sell debt instruments to lower prices and increase yields which is said to be a tighter monetary policy Just like when I tighten and loosen my belt around thanksgiving dinner according to how much stuffing I devour
1567528210685911041,2022-09-07 15:00:23+00:00,13,0,4 Assets amp liabilities must balance An increase decrease on the A side leads to an equal decrease increase on the L side During a balance sheet expansion they buy debt instruments like Treasuries and MBSs to increase their price and lower yields looser monetary policy
1567528204365086727,2022-09-07 15:00:21+00:00,12,0,3 Just like companies have balance sheets so does the Fed We know that it has the two primary goals of high employment and price stability They target these goals by using their balance sheet The Fed decides what it owns assets and what it owes liabilities
1567528198874750981,2022-09-07 15:00:20+00:00,12,0,2 While inflation amp rates have dominated headlines the mechanics behind them are less understood Last week the Fed stepped on the gas of its Quantitative Tightening QT program by accelerating the rate at which it unwinds its balance sheet What balance sheet

1565353837766283266,2022-09-01 15:00:12+00:00,8,0,12 So it s clear that while the global economy struggles Canadian seed companies continue to come up with innovative new ideas As they say necessity is the mother of invention Even in hard times good entrepreneurs will still find ways to make money

1565353831894257665,2022-09-01 15:00:11+00:00,3,0,9 Now Canada s start ups are looking to capitalize on the rapid growth afforded by the tech sector We are seeing a willingness to hold with investors as they stay the course in their investments a testament to the maturing Canadian venture ecosystem said Furlong
1565353829805490177,2022-09-01 15:00:10+00:00,3,0,8 Kim Furlong is the CEO of CVCA a venture fund association She praised the ambition of Canadian startup CEOs The US has long held a global edge in technology which is reflected in its seed companies Canada has traditionally been more focused on the secondary industry
1565353827922227200,2022-09-01 15:00:10+00:00,3,0,7 Canada saw 104 seed funding deals in Q2 This is still only a fraction of the U S market where even after a significant drop in activity over 2 000 deals were completed Why has Canada s tiny seed market proven so resilient

1565353824038309889,2022-09-01 15:00:09+00:00,3,0,5 Still the global seed market has been suffering lately U S seed funding fell 35 between the first two quarters of this year But there s one market that s been holding up strong
1565353822159241216,2022-09-01 15:00:08+00:00,5,0,4 But seed funding can be protected from a weak economy These companies operate in such a small niche that they re insulated from global conditions Factors like quality of management scalability amp tech advantage matter far more than interest rates inflation or GDP growth

1564991461195747331,2022-08-31 15:00:15+00:00,2,0,16 The recent move in the uranium price was due to Japan s major policy shift on nuclear energy and an announcement that it would restart more idled plants The conclusion to this thesis Long Uranium miners as prices come up with market deficits
1564991458427506688,2022-08-31 15:00:14+00:00,0,0,15 We have to look at 2 components demand required by reactors in order to generate nuclear energy and supply uranium mined We then need to look at inventories as well as projected supply demand imbalances Right now there is a projected DEFICIT over the next 8 years
1564991455814377475,2022-08-31 15:00:13+00:00,0,0,14 Conventional mines have a mill where the ore is crushed ground and then leached with sulfuric acid to dissolve the uranium oxides At the mill of a conventional mine the uranium is then separated by ion exchange before being dried and packed usually as U3O8

1564991434524082176,2022-08-31 15:00:08+00:00,4,0,8 China has 46 nuclear reactors under construction compared to TWO in the US with an overarching goal of 150 more nuclear reactors over the next 15 years Since China is by far the largest consumer of coal in the world a shift to nuclear promotes a green initiative
1564991431676203013,2022-08-31 15:00:08+00:00,4,0,7 Today there are about 440 nuclear power reactors in 33 countries with a combined capacity that provided about 10 of the world s electricity About 55 power reactors are currently being constructed in 15 countries notably China India Russia and the United Arab Emirates
1564991429381857282,2022-08-31 15:00:07+00:00,2,0,6 Nuclear energy comes from splitting atoms in a reactor to heat water into steam turn a turbine and generate electricity It has no carbon emissions because reactors use uranium not fossil fuels Nuclear plants are always on avoid interruptions and support the grid 24 7
1564991426882043906,2022-08-31 15:00:06+00:00,4,0,5 This is much more harmful to the environment and instead of ramping up Nuclear production they have continued on their path of decommissioning existing reactors This is widely due to the narrative around the dangers of nuclear

1564991417717592071,2022-08-31 15:00:04+00:00,4,0,2 On top of Nord Stream s capacity limitations we have global droughts causing unnavigable water levels to the point where the Rhine cannot be used to transport coal to power plants Current renewable build out capacity is abysmal compared to demand We need an alternative

1562098125501759490,2022-08-23 15:23:10+00:00,56,3,18 This has happened and will continue to happen until prices come back down to where affordability gets back to realistic levels For this to happen either housing prices come down even more or interest rates come down and my bet is the former will happen before the latter
1562098123895455744,2022-08-23 15:23:09+00:00,30,2,17 How does it end You ve heard the saying that high prices are the cure for high prices Meaning demand will eventually weaken after consumers experience sticker shock from high prices causing the market to correct to a lower equilibrium
1562098122020487168,2022-08-23 15:23:09+00:00,32,2,16 Cheap debt with relatively stable wage growth increased the buying power of every consumer across the board On top of this foreign buyers flooded major city centers to use this as a store of exorbitant amounts of cash We are now getting a violent wake up call
1562098120187592704,2022-08-23 15:23:08+00:00,37,4,15 The way that I see it this is a correction from an irrational base just like we had in certain high flying tech stocks A prolonged period of a low interest rate environment led to rampant investment and speculation in the real estate market
1562098117968904196,2022-08-23 15:23:08+00:00,37,2,14 The good news is this is not a systematic failure and loss of confidence in the lending environment like the housing crisis in 2008 2008 was a different beast because lenders were packaging debt into seemingly more attractive tranches that ended up being a house of cards
1562098113745240064,2022-08-23 15:23:07+00:00,31,2,13 We ve also got existing home sales dropping off a cliff It s not rocket surgery Lowering demand from interest rate hikes that eat into affordability are collapsing both volumes and values of home sales
1562098110029041666,2022-08-23 15:23:06+00:00,28,2,12 As well as more and more home sellers need to DROP prices in order to close a sale
1562098108103786497,2022-08-23 15:23:06+00:00,29,2,11 We re also seeing this clearly shown when it comes to a massive drop off in listings that experienced a bidding war
1562098106115801089,2022-08-23 15:23:05+00:00,42,1,10 The net result is a higher demand for rental units higher rents while there is also less demand for buying units lowering housing prices Here is a chart of US housing affordability of carrying a house blue as well as mortgage payment as a percentage of income red
1562098101875347456,2022-08-23 15:23:04+00:00,41,1,9 Let s say you bring in a net of 5k month after taxes Assuming no other inflows outflows your Debt Service Coverage Ratio went from 2 5 to 1 7 This is causing banks to reject far more mortgage applications based on the lendee s failure to meet DSCR requirements
1562098100080189443,2022-08-23 15:23:04+00:00,52,2,8 The root of the entire housing retreat is a loss of affordability due to rising interest rates Let s take a 500k mortgage amortizing over 25 years Old rate 1 45 1 987 monthly payment New Rate 4 95 2 894 monthly payment That s a 46 increase
1562098098536697857,2022-08-23 15:23:03+00:00,29,2,7 Rents change when leases expire which typically happens annually This creates a lag between changes in indexes like Zillow s and those in the BLS s rent measure making these figures a lagging indicator The same happens on the way down making the changes STICKY
1562098096879927297,2022-08-23 15:23:03+00:00,25,1,6 If a housing unit is occupied by the owners the BLS computes what it would cost the owner to rent a similar place known as Owners Equivalent Rent OER The problem with OER is that it s tough to find direct comps so this number could be stale
1562098095151890433,2022-08-23 15:23:02+00:00,29,2,5 Housing represents about a third of the value of the market basket of goods and services that the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS uses to track inflation in the Consumer Price Index For tenant rent the BLS counts cash rent paid utilities government subsidies
1562098093490900994,2022-08-23 15:23:02+00:00,40,1,4 With interest rates on the rise affordability has been rapidly decreasing pushing many potential home buyers into the rental markets and further spiking rents All of this flows into the spike in CPI figures since rent makes up a large portion of the reading

1560642806464405506,2022-08-19 15:00:15+00:00,78,8,12 Soros likes to be ahead of this curve He has an incredible track record of getting multi billion dollar bets right All because he anticipated the stories that the market was telling itself This is the power of reflexivity
1560642804337889281,2022-08-19 15:00:14+00:00,51,6,11 Reflexivity produces unstoppable feedback loops Investors see prices going up and buy pushing them further So they make a profit and think they must have been right Often they buy even more Eventually prices become completely detached from reality
1560642802387542017,2022-08-19 15:00:14+00:00,49,5,10 Tesla is an established EV marque the clear market leader Ford is a massive American automaker that s breaking into the EV market Rivian is an up and coming brand that can innovate quickly And you can trust that Soros has reflexivity in mind on these trades
1560642800613347330,2022-08-19 15:00:13+00:00,67,5,9 So what is Soros doing today His largest position is electric vehicle maker Rivian He s recently added to his positions in Tesla and Ford This gives him a multi pronged play on the electric car market
1560642798650474497,2022-08-19 15:00:13+00:00,56,4,8 When Soros made his bet against the Bank of England he wasn t just thinking about the fair value of the Sterling He was anticipating the panic selling that would follow the ERM withdrawal This is the theory of reflexivity in play
1560642796830146560,2022-08-19 15:00:12+00:00,45,4,7 On Black Wednesday the GDP was withdrawn from the ERM mechanism The exchange rate crashed and Soros pocketed 1bn profit And his fund made another 1bn from parallel trades like longs on British stocks and German bonds
1560642794695233541,2022-08-19 15:00:12+00:00,43,4,6 To see reflexivity in action let s look at Soros s greatest trade Black Wednesday In 1992 Soros took a short position against the British Sterling worth US 10bn worth of GBP Soros knew the British government couldn t artificially prop up the currency forever
1560642792849780737,2022-08-19 15:00:11+00:00,64,6,5 This seems obvious Traders chase trends and markets generate their own momentum that far outpaces the fundamentals But it contradicts a lot of mainstream economic theory The efficient market hypothesis would say that prices only change on new information
1560642790844878848,2022-08-19 15:00:11+00:00,103,7,4 The theory of reflexivity underpins all of Soros s trades He believes that investors don t base their decisions on measurable fundamentals but on a filtered perception of reality
1560642788928004096,2022-08-19 15:00:10+00:00,61,4,3 Soros founded his first hedge fund in 1969 He s seen countless market crashes come and go He knows better than anyone that no bear market lasts forever With the Nasdaq 100 down 18 4 this year now is the perfect opportunity to buy shares for a big discount
1560642786981924864,2022-08-19 15:00:10+00:00,76,7,2 Lately Soros Fund Management has been betting big on Big Tech It bolstered its holdings in Amazon Alphabet and Salesforce three of its top ten positions Why is Soros so bullish

1559555626153418752,2022-08-16 15:00:11+00:00,14,2,12 While this is a monumental bill from the clean energy side the impact of build out capacity will take a while to recognize And while the EV credit takes steps in the right direction to curb climate change it doesn t do anything to lower the price of mayonnaise
1559555620990324736,2022-08-16 15:00:09+00:00,7,1,11 So does this bill meet up to its name Not really The FOMC meetings have a FAR greater impact on inflation than this bill does but the amount of capital being directed towards these initiatives could have an impact on overall inflation over the long term
1559555618486231046,2022-08-16 15:00:09+00:00,12,3,10 However while some automakers like TSLA amp GM have well developed domestic supply chains no EV manufacturer currently meets all the bill s requirements for the EV subsidy This is because China is so dominant in the supply chain for batties Onshoring is needed
1559555615957164033,2022-08-16 15:00:08+00:00,10,1,9 If successful this legislation will pour 370 billion into energy security and climate change through tax credits for wind and solar loans to private clean energy companies and EV subsidies Make no bones about it This is the largest climate investment in US history
1559555613025337344,2022-08-16 15:00:07+00:00,7,1,8 Health coverage will also be more affordable for 13 million people because the IRA extends enhanced ACA marketplace subsidies through 2025 The average enrollee will save 800 per year on premiums The subsidy extension would prevent 3 million people from becoming uninsured
1559555610085048322,2022-08-16 15:00:07+00:00,5,0,7 Healthcare The bill lets Medicare negotiate drug prices on behalf of consumers and limits out of pocket prescription costs for Medicare beneficiaries to 2 000 per year The cap would save roughly 1 million seniors about 1 000 each year
1559555607845380096,2022-08-16 15:00:06+00:00,5,1,6 1 Buyback Excise Tax Dividends and buybacks are ways that corporations transfer profits to shareholders but only dividends are taxed This law would see corporations pay a 1 excise tax when conducting buybacks reducing the tax advantages for stock buybacks
1559555605089718272,2022-08-16 15:00:06+00:00,12,1,5 The IRA would provide 80 billion in additional funding for the IRS which would result in 204 billion in additional revenue collections Sounds like a pretty good ROI This however not so fun
1559555601495113730,2022-08-16 15:00:05+00:00,9,1,4 Corporations with at least 1 billion in profits over the last three years will have a new tax rate of 15 This tax rate will be applied to worldwide book profits instead of what they typically report to the IRS for tax purposes after write offs
1559555596717891587,2022-08-16 15:00:04+00:00,8,1,3 It will finance these initiatives through a 15 corporate minimum tax rate a 1 excise tax on buybacks tax enforcement prescription drug pricing reform This would have a deficit reduction of 300B The idea here is a lower budget deficit lower inflation
1559555591105921024,2022-08-16 15:00:02+00:00,9,1,2 The Inflation Reduction Act IRA of 2022 was sent to president Biden for his signature on Friday The bill will spend money by boosting domestic energy production and manufacturing through renewables reducing out of pocket healthcare costs and boosting the IRS budget

1556666100015927296,2022-08-08 15:38:14+00:00,8,0,14 This allows the parent company to be patient with ultimate liquidity events at the end of each asset life while recycling capital to further fund growth When there s blood in the water the sharks circle And Thoma Bravo is the Megladon
1556666098178744325,2022-08-08 15:38:13+00:00,7,0,13 I would argue that Thoma Bravo does not care about this It invests in companies over multi decade time frames that are compounders of capital with enough organic free cash flow to fund aggressive growth profiles
1556666096459161602,2022-08-08 15:38:13+00:00,4,0,12 A common criticism right now in the private investing space is that a lot of the portfolio companies have stale NAVs meaning they are yet to be marked to market and do not reflect the current valuation levels
1556666094840160257,2022-08-08 15:38:13+00:00,4,0,11 Recent acquisitions include ProofPoint April 2021 for 12 3B Anaplan March 2022 for 10 7B SailPoint April 2022 for 6 9B Its deep expertise in enterprise software particularly cybersecurity makes it one of the most knowledgeable acquirers in the space
1556666092763889665,2022-08-08 15:38:12+00:00,7,0,10 Thoma Bravo looks at payback periods instead of multiple revenues Then they tell the rest of the market that they ve got it wrong and scoop up these public assets at what they deem a discount to fair intrinsic value
1556666087546257410,2022-08-08 15:38:11+00:00,7,0,9 The reason why I think Thoma Bravo is so relevant to markets right now is the absolutely massive multiple compression that Growth Software has experienced over the last 8 months Even from recent highs of 35x now being sub 10x is bringing Thoma Bravo to the table
1556666082835980289,2022-08-08 15:38:10+00:00,3,0,8 How about fundraising Earlier this year it was reported that Thoma Bravo raised more than 20B for its 15th flagship fund The Discover Fund IV also raised 4 5B and Explore Fund II brought in 1 75B bringing the altogether total to more than 28B across three funds
1556666081070170117,2022-08-08 15:38:09+00:00,7,0,7 By organizing the funds by portfolio company size they can offer investors exposure to a specific segment on the growth spectrum As for returns According to public data analyzed by Forbes its funds returned 30 net annually and since the beginning of 2015
1556666079254122498,2022-08-08 15:38:09+00:00,6,0,6 Thoma Bravo is structured as a limited partnership PE firm with 4 main Fund Families Flagship series of PE funds that focus on investing in large software Discover middle market software Explore lower middle market software Credit debt investments in software

1556666072551620610,2022-08-08 15:38:07+00:00,5,0,4 Typically when you think of PE and corporate raiders you think of a bunch of consultant type folk coming in and restructure read cut jobs Thoma Bravo is the exact opposite of this They focus on not only cutting costs but growing revenue as well
1556666067665158146,2022-08-08 15:38:06+00:00,7,0,3 Thoma Bravo is a private equity and growth capital firm that focuses on the application infrastructure cybersecurity software and technology enabled business service sectors It was formed in 2008 and has a Build and Buy strategy as its mantra

1549408752796946432,2022-07-19 15:00:07+00:00,14,0,10 HOWEVER The tide might be about to change as the market is widely expecting a US recession and moderating inflation figures over the next year These two developments should tighten policy spreads which would lead to a reversal of the recent trend in DXY
1549408751106637831,2022-07-19 15:00:07+00:00,14,0,9 Remember when it comes to currencies everything is connected In Europe Russia nationalizing Gas is wreaking havoc on energy stability as commodity spikes higher inflation Higher inflation higher rates but rates are tough to raise with recessions on the horizon
1549408749303091200,2022-07-19 15:00:07+00:00,16,0,8 The main driver of the recent DXY strength is the central bank monetary policy gap The Fed is starting to ramp rates up therefore increasing the DEMAND for USD while the ECB and BoJ are still too hesitant in getting aggressive to combat inflation
1549408747449204739,2022-07-19 15:00:06+00:00,15,1,7 Key factors affecting the level of the DXY and USD are The role of bonds Economic outlook Inflation Central bank policy Political stability Trade balances Main takeaway here is that price equilibrium is set where demand and supply meet much like other goods
1549408744898977797,2022-07-19 15:00:06+00:00,15,0,6 It s a weighted basket This means certain currency pairings have a much greater impact on the overall level of the DXY The DXY can be very useful to gauge the difference between USD and EUR with a flavour of JPY in there but useless when thinking about China for example
1549408740922851335,2022-07-19 15:00:05+00:00,10,0,5 This makes the USD exchange rate very important in the global economy The DXY index or Dixie is a basket of global currencies vs USD and has seen very strong performance over the last 12 months But the DXY is not a simple average of currencies used across the world
1549408739085762560,2022-07-19 15:00:04+00:00,26,3,4 In 2019 62 of official government central bank foreign exchange reserves were in USD with the euro at 20 the yen at 5 the pound at 4 5 and others including the renminbi all below 2 Nearly 90 of foreign currency trading involves USD on 1 side of the transaction
1549408737156366337,2022-07-19 15:00:04+00:00,16,1,3 Reserve currencies are those held widely by governments central banks and private institutions to conduct international trade and financial transactions A clear example that shows the USD is still the global reserve currency is how much global central banks deal with it
1549408734916624388,2022-07-19 15:00:03+00:00,30,2,2 First we must understand the importance of the US dollar USD when it comes to its status as a reserve currency Despite what the long bearded bird app guy says the US Dollar is still the world s reserve currency
1549408732374876161,2022-07-19 15:00:03+00:00,228,48,1 The Almighty Dollar The US Dollar has quietly been on a tear since the start of 2021 and has jumped again in the last couple of weeks But what do we mean when we talk about The Dollar and how does its movement impact global markets Time for a

1547597759259107331,2022-07-14 15:03:53+00:00,56,1,13 So perhaps eventually another economic block will overtake the USA But this would require seismic economic shifts that take at least decades probably centuries to come into effect Until then you can rest easy that the USD will be the world s currency of choice
1547597756394397698,2022-07-14 15:03:52+00:00,53,1,12 Japan s declining consumer base cannot match the resilience of the USA Europe is politically and fiscally discordant India and China lack political stability and dedication to free markets Crypto has yet to prove itself long term
1547597753160593410,2022-07-14 15:03:51+00:00,48,2,11 In 1971 when the dollar was unpegged from the gold standard the doomsayers said that the collapse of the US hegemony was only a matter of time Back then it was the Japanese Yen that would take over Since then it has been the Euro the Renminbi the Rupee or Bitcoin
1547597749654237187,2022-07-14 15:03:51+00:00,79,7,10 This is why crypto will never become the world s reserve currency either The reason for US dominance is not natural resources a large population or government spending It is and has always been the resilience of the US consumer and the strength of free markets
1547597746206478336,2022-07-14 15:03:50+00:00,60,2,9 The US is the world s leading lender of last resort Unless Europe becomes politically unified it can never act as the leader of the world s economy And China s communist rulers are unwilling to give up their tight control of money markets
1547597743241056259,2022-07-14 15:03:49+00:00,58,3,8 So even if DXY was down 12 this year Dorsey would still be wrong The US dollar is the world s reserve currency because of its unique global status No other country has embraced free and liquid markets to the extent of the USA The dollar has political advantages as well
1547597739839479816,2022-07-14 15:03:48+00:00,70,5,7 According to the IMF 59 of the world s allocated foreign currency reserves are in USD EUR is second at 20 and JPY is a distant third at 5 In 2020 nearly 90 of forex transactions involved the dollar And nearly half of cross border bank loans were denominated in USD
1547597736471511045,2022-07-14 15:03:48+00:00,58,3,6 ECB economists talk big but they re slow to act base rate is still negative More than any other market factor DXY correlates near perfectly to bond yields A hawkish Fed means a stronger dollar But in fact the dollar s global reserve status runs much deeper
1547597732608503808,2022-07-14 15:03:47+00:00,42,2,5 After a slow response to inflation last year the Fed has implemented a rapid series of rates hikes Base rate has risen by 1 5 percentage points since the pandemic And markets expect more hikes by the end of the year
1547597729110433793,2022-07-14 15:03:46+00:00,69,5,4 At times of turmoil the US economy is often the safest market China is still struggling with lockdowns and Europe is facing an energy crisis without Russian oil The secret to USD strength this year may lie with the much maligned Fed Reserve
1547597726375784448,2022-07-14 15:03:45+00:00,52,2,3 In June Dorsey tweeted when did the dollar lose global reserve currency status His replies were filled with USD naysayers Biden had killed the dollar Or the pandemic Or the sanctions on Russia Or the great recession 15 years ago Obviously none of them were right
1547597723599114240,2022-07-14 15:03:44+00:00,93,3,2 The US Dollar has not lost its global dominance nor is it going to anytime soon In fact USD is on its strongest bull run in years The DXY which tracks USD against a basket of currencies is up 12 YTD to its highest level since 2002 Why this strength
1547597720688291844,2022-07-14 15:03:44+00:00,621,101,Jack Dorsey said that the US dollar had lost its reserve currency status Now one dollar buys you exactly one euro and the Dollar Index DXY is the only bull market in town Here s what Dorsey got wrong

1546879731173400578,2022-07-12 15:30:42+00:00,15,0,The number one question going forward is How will the dust settle after over aggressive expansionary fiscal policy in the United States Can the US get back to growth if we are indeed tipped into recession if not already in one Time will tell
1546879729353068545,2022-07-12 15:30:41+00:00,20,0,Japan s population is also shrinking and aging putting a heavy impact on overall GDP growth and productivity So the next key indicator to look at is if we see a similar shrinking of the overall economy in the United States after the most recent bubbles have deflated
1546879726870044672,2022-07-12 15:30:41+00:00,27,0,So will this happen in the US I say No The lack of recovery in Japan is largely due to demographics amp competition During this outflow of capital it lost a lot of the competitive advantages it had built up in the manufacturing industry as the rest of Asia caught up
1546879724781281281,2022-07-12 15:30:40+00:00,11,0,There were many separate reasons for the cause of the collapse Amongst them are easy monetary policy correlated land amp stock markets international trade imbalances and distortions in tax systems But I just call it a simple form of gravity What comes up must come down
1546879722830921730,2022-07-12 15:30:40+00:00,14,0,A key component of this asset bubble was that stock trading volumes accounted for by corporations rose from 19 to 39 while cross ownership rose from 39 to 67 This had the effect of Small public float higher volatility Higher cross ownership higher correlation
1546879720947687425,2022-07-12 15:30:39+00:00,12,0,This problem rippled through to the stock market Many of the corporations had substantial value in owning their own real estate This further correlated the turn of the real estate market with the overall sell off in the stock market

1546879717344792581,2022-07-12 15:30:38+00:00,22,0,The bubble really started in the real estate market Land price increases from 1985 1991 Industrial 162 Residential 180 Commercial Land 303 This was due to a flood of interest from the international finance community opening up in Tokyo and other major cities in Japan
1546879715176337408,2022-07-12 15:30:38+00:00,23,3,This story is going to sound familiar There was an asset price bubble in Japan from 1986 to 1991 that was characterized by a rapid acceleration of asset prices overheated economic activity and an uncontrolled money supply and credit expansion

1544335864851009536,2022-07-05 15:02:17+00:00,16,1,13 For now the drop in key commodities may allow inflation expectations to ease off and with that the higher for longer rate pressure that we have been under In the coming months it might be time to fade commodities and sharpen your pencil on beat up darlings risk on
1544335863290658819,2022-07-05 15:02:16+00:00,15,2,12 So what does this all mean It appears on the inflationary front that bad news is good news as anticipation of a recession rises so do fears over shrinking demand across goods The cure for high prices is high prices
1544335861260640260,2022-07-05 15:02:16+00:00,12,0,11 We re also starting to see green shoots when it comes to the food crisis as well Supply may not be as impaired as we think because other areas are starting to compensate The Bloomberg Agriculture Spot Subindex is also on track for its biggest monthly drop since 2011
1544335857380892674,2022-07-05 15:02:15+00:00,8,0,10 Similarly when you look at the outperformance of the Energy Sector from a GICS Index YTD versus the market it is still up big but gave about half of those returns back
1544335853459316736,2022-07-05 15:02:14+00:00,11,1,9 We see this particularly in the industrial metals space I agree with much of this thread but the 10yr avg growth trend is very difficult to pull as a baseline considering the black swan events that have occurred Either way the trend is down
1544335851156553731,2022-07-05 15:02:13+00:00,15,1,8 While inflation has been running wild we are finally starting to see some cracks in June Since a lot of growth was pulled forward on a YoY basis we are now lapping comps meaning the explosive growth we saw in price levels gets re rated from a higher base
1544335847142690818,2022-07-05 15:02:12+00:00,16,0,7 We ll leave it up to economists to debate as to the exact percentage split and which is more important but to me it seems like supply side improvements need to be made in order to see any peaking in the inflationary readings no matter how hawkish the Fed signals
1544335844777119745,2022-07-05 15:02:12+00:00,12,0,6 So if it s the Fed s job to control inflation but they can only really influence the demand side of the equation and not the supply side it makes sense to see just which force is dominant when it comes to inflation BUT
1544335841002242052,2022-07-05 15:02:11+00:00,15,0,5 But there are 2 sides to the equation amp the Fed only has influence over 1 Demand The propensity for the end consumer to spend money on goods Supply Actors that produce goods through processing and manufacturing raw materials The Fed does not control the supply side
1544335838787473410,2022-07-05 15:02:10+00:00,17,0,4 Higher rates generally mean more contractionary policy which increases borrowing costs across the board This causes a contraction in business activity and therefore revenues and profits Which ultimately affects equities in a negative manner
1544335835536957444,2022-07-05 15:02:10+00:00,25,3,3 The commodity market is so important right now because of its effects on Fed policy and interest rates Higher commodity prices rising inflation Since the Fed aims to limit inflation as part of its mandate they raise rates to contain it
1544335833788043265,2022-07-05 15:02:09+00:00,17,0,2 The commodity market is now at the most critical crossroad it has been in the last several decades The issues are plentiful on both the supply and demand sides But the impact does not stop at the grocery store or the gas pump It ripples throughout the entire economy
1544335831690878976,2022-07-05 15:02:09+00:00,178,41,1 It s no secret commodities have been on an absolute tear That ll happen when global supply chains shutter consumption patterns swing wildly war is launched and inventory levels shift from just in time to just in case But now we re seeing a pullback

1541802206806130696,2022-06-28 15:14:26+00:00,16,1,MAIN TAKEAWAY What we had here was contagion in a fragile system Because there are so many intertwined players in the ecosystem the collapse of one can bring about the default of tiered obligations which exacerbates selling pressure Loss of confidence breeds contagion
1541802202351771651,2022-06-28 15:14:24+00:00,11,1,It then came to light that 3AC was right in the thick of it with the Luna UST collapse 3AC bought 560M worth of locked Luna unable to take out which collapse to 600 dollars not a typo
1541802200728588289,2022-06-28 15:14:24+00:00,10,1,This put their LTV at 77 They did this across MANY different platforms Instead of posting more collateral with their crypto commitments locked up they were ghosting their commitments This forced liquidation at lending platforms further exacerbating the selloff
1541802199189159936,2022-06-28 15:14:24+00:00,7,1,The other collapse was 3AC 3AC is a crypto VC that was managing around 3 Billion in assets at its peak which ranks them in the top 3 However it was revealed that 3AC had 245M of ETH deposited at lending platform Aave and they borrowed 189M in USDC and USDT against it
1541802197440159746,2022-06-28 15:14:23+00:00,6,0,Hacks of their wallet and the crypto market crash caused problems But the final undoing was investing customer tokens through staking ETH with Lido Finance which went under a similar de pegging debacle ultimately causing Celsius to gate withdrawals What a shitshow
1541802194474860544,2022-06-28 15:14:23+00:00,10,2,Celsius is a crypto lending platform that offered aggressive interest rates yields to investors so that they would deposit their crypto to the platform Since they had to pay out high yields this led them to be overaggressive seeking returns to cover their costs
1541802189223608320,2022-06-28 15:14:21+00:00,6,0,We are now seeing the ripple effects Luna s collapse caused forced liquidations after failed margin calls to over levered funds and is creating a domino effect of selling The most recent casualties are Celsius and Three Arrow Capital 3AC
1541802187550068737,2022-06-28 15:14:21+00:00,6,0,According to Terra s protocol only 100M worth of UST can be burned for Luna per day This made investors PANIC because 1 They could not take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity 2 The fundamental mechanics needed in order to keep the peg were violated Cue insanity
1541802186035937280,2022-06-28 15:14:21+00:00,7,0,Luna was the third largest until it blew up Luna is an algorithmic stablecoin that lost its peg to the underlying currency A large sell order came in on UST which pushed the price down to 91 cents As traders piled in to arbitrage this discrepancy they hit a speed bump
1541802183796080641,2022-06-28 15:14:20+00:00,6,0,Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies where the value is pegged to another currency commodity or financial instrument These coins aim to pursue price stability by maintaining reserve assets as collateral or through algorithmic formulas that are supposed to control supply
1541802182181281793,2022-06-28 15:14:20+00:00,9,1,This one has it all murky collateralization hedge fund blow ups massive layoffs and sketchy billionaires Throughout my criticism of this side of the story I want to express upfront that I am extremely bullish on the future of crypto This is a story about the bad apples
1541802180075823105,2022-06-28 15:14:19+00:00,9,1,We ve had this run up in crypto along with flash crashes along the way But this one feels a bit different It feels less like short term volatility and more like a loss of confidence in a system What we re seeing now is a modern day bank run on a lot of digital assets
1541802177638825985,2022-06-28 15:14:19+00:00,79,11,During periods of rampant excess we move from valuations based on present value of future cash flows to valuations based on stories How compelling is your story What if it loses confidence A loss of confidence contagion This is happening NOW in crypto Let s dive in

1538946019257470977,2022-06-20 18:04:57+00:00,59,1,We re in very volatile times right now I think a solid strategy is to keep extra cash on hand and keep dollar cost averaging in We ll be in this bear market for longer than expected but as we get through to the other side of it there will be PLENTY of opportunities
1538946016828919814,2022-06-20 18:04:57+00:00,38,3,What are Major Money Managers saying Buffett Long Oil amp Gas Tends to do well in periods of inflation Ackman The Fed is behind the curve Druckenmiller Too much easy money for too long will cause a longer bear market

1534188983609135104,2022-06-07 15:02:12+00:00,20,1,However we are starting to see more and more headlines of Major companies cutting jobs Just like any other cycle when you build out excess capacity over hiring the fat has to be trimmed eventually especially in a rising raw material cost world
1534188980471795712,2022-06-07 15:02:11+00:00,14,0,As you can see when you click to zoom the current figure of 200k means the labor market is one of the strongest it has ever been hitting a mid march 2022 low of 166k This is the reason the jobs market does not get much mention because people are getting back to work
