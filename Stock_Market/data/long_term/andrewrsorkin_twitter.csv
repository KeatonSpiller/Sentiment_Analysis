1428385956709769219,2021-08-19 15:58:44+00:00,2,0,lab Thanks Dan My reading of the studies suggests that rapid tests can be an effective way to test if they are used by the symptomatic or serially on asymptomatic The challenge on most people using them serially is the cost And to do it right serially would mean almost daily
1428384938936655882,2021-08-19 15:54:42+00:00,1,0,lab What is you view on how to think about accuracy of rapid tests and the proper use cases lab
1428383149353054217,2021-08-19 15:47:35+00:00,0,0,lab My understanding is that these tests often provide the user a false sense of security So you re right If the test shows you re negative and you re actually positive it is unlikely you ll spread it in the hour or two post test result But a day later you may be contagious
1428381322360377352,2021-08-19 15:40:19+00:00,2,0,True I have used it is awesome Best device out there But it isn t avail to most yet And I don t imagine it would be used by most people daily Cost would be too high 20 min is fast but not for family of 4 if used every morning Need individual devices

1428377851682766858,2021-08-19 15:26:32+00:00,8,1,Those tests are sadly not accurate enough to rely on especially in asymtopmatic cases So if you wanted to run surveillance testing to bring together people at an office or for an event those tests won t do an especially good job of catching all positive cases
1428373515284123649,2021-08-19 15:09:18+00:00,5,0,So far it seems false positive rate on COVID tests is near zero It is the false negative rate that is high If you re running a company for example and you want all your people together maskless vaccines may not be enough given breakthrough rate Testing vaccine could do it
1428371225919819781,2021-08-19 15:00:12+00:00,1,0,Yes but in truth it isn t that reliable And at 20 a test it isn t something you re going to be using multiple times a week which oddly enough would make it more reliable based on the research
1428368842082893824,2021-08-19 14:50:44+00:00,48,2,BTW There are some good new testing efforts coming like one from that we ve covered on air But none are cheap or reliable enough to use multiple times a week at scale assuming you want to bring lots of people maskless together indoors w no risk of spread
1428366753780797450,2021-08-19 14:42:26+00:00,15,0,they are fast but they are hardly reliable and they aren t cheap especially if you were going to use them regularly
1428366075687669771,2021-08-19 14:39:44+00:00,797,55,In addition to vaccines shouldn t we simultaneously be focused on coming up with fast cheap reliable tests If we re going to be living with COVID for years testing may prove crucial Something that even could be done daily

1410722863712141315,2021-07-01 22:11:55+00:00,2,0,The reason the Wild West version would be kore expensive is because Apple would make little money from App Stores since it is equivalent of jail token phone And no support because it can t guarantee security of third party app stores That s the point

1410378249088245765,2021-06-30 23:22:32+00:00,0,0,there s an interesting agency issue in the wfh wfo debate senior management is responsible for collective results employee farther down the ladder are more likely responsible for themselves those can be in conflict
1410376749448376329,2021-06-30 23:16:35+00:00,1,0,totally hear you on that
1410371246173437952,2021-06-30 22:54:43+00:00,2,0,Interesting piece Employers should be open to hearing employees But the truth is shareholders board hire management to set strategy Management matters Steve Jobs created modern Apple It wasn t simply the employees as a collective Before he returned company was failing

1409965922945847296,2021-06-29 20:04:06+00:00,0,0,You can like dislike My point is App Store is a store Developers specifically make products to be sold in its store on known terms almost equivalent of white labelIng for a retailer Then they complain Do you know a store that sells any every product on makers terms
1409961048447275011,2021-06-29 19:44:44+00:00,0,0,Facinating But why do we think digital is different than analog Many companies make package and ship their products for different retailers in different ways to meet the terms of the retailer the retailer s rationale for their policies may be about margins sales volume etc
1409919145383243776,2021-06-29 16:58:13+00:00,2,0,franceschetti That s freezing

1409906877295640581,2021-06-29 16:09:29+00:00,21,5,Judge The market definition inquiry in this case is somewhat unusual because unlike familiar consumer goods like tobacco or office supplies there is no obvious or universally agreed upon definition of just what a personal social networking service is
1409853669252775945,2021-06-29 12:38:03+00:00,1,0,not an illusion it is a coloboma
1409484785723101189,2021-06-28 12:12:14+00:00,0,0,basically but they d sell it as an official product
1409481120681451524,2021-06-28 11:57:40+00:00,2,0,Nope Same device On one version iOS is controlled the way it is today the other is totally open and more expensive but there is no customer support The two versions would have to be marketed like that so that there is no customer confusion about what they are getting
1408933750847770628,2021-06-26 23:42:37+00:00,10,0,because once you decide to let users sideload apps have multiple app stores with no oversight you ve given up a lot as a brand if you open up the experience so that you can t control it or guarantee you can protect users it is probably better to say so up front
1408930943281344514,2021-06-26 23:31:28+00:00,21,1,And the results of the poll are in
1408889963475787777,2021-06-26 20:48:37+00:00,87,3,I think this is about the other Sorkin
1408569153221496842,2021-06-25 23:33:50+00:00,22,0,The reason this hypothetical Wild West version of iPhone is priced at a premium is to make up for the fees would lose from App Store since the platform would be open
1408567532693471237,2021-06-25 23:27:24+00:00,66,10,What would happen if sold two versions of iPhone 1 iPhone Classic marketed as secure device with controlled App Store 2 Wild West version sold at higher price w multiple app stores side loading etc w big caveat no tech support or guarantees Which would you buy
1407675174363750400,2021-06-23 12:21:29+00:00,5,1,Not true Charities are exempt from paying taxes
1407475554996174861,2021-06-22 23:08:16+00:00,0,0,stonk Nope Never saw it before
1407063107554381832,2021-06-21 19:49:21+00:00,1,0,Z How do I become an influencer
1407012399027306496,2021-06-21 16:27:51+00:00,2,0,Just seeing this A worker being paid 60k lets say ostensibly can t lose money The owner of the company being paid 60k in salary could lose money in a year in which costs were more than revenue He she could fairly deduct losses so they aren t taxed on money they didn t make
1406988861301997569,2021-06-21 14:54:19+00:00,3,0,My take is they appear to have paid their taxes according to the law spirit of the law I didn t see any red flags about taking advantage of interest expenses to lower taxes or the other chicanery that we would use to label someone a tax dodger
1406986343457120259,2021-06-21 14:44:19+00:00,1,0,nope he runs a hedge fund short term trading so no long term capital gains
1406961300266233866,2021-06-21 13:04:48+00:00,3,0,Yes but that wasn t enough to offset the losses since his net worth is tied up in the fund
1406960707556581377,2021-06-21 13:02:27+00:00,1,0,Explain this to me If you managed to save some money but then lost your job for three years and your net worth fell at the same time you think you should pay taxes in those years Everyone s entitled to a view I d be curious to hear yours
1406958778344423429,2021-06-21 12:54:47+00:00,1,0,They were actual losses So much so that investors pulled money from his firm In 2012 he managed 5 6 billion Three years later he managed 1 3 billion
1406954958533058569,2021-06-21 12:39:36+00:00,1,0,light Oh And 95 of his net worth is in the fund so when it goes down his net worth goes down too

1402629313741131779,2021-06-09 14:11:02+00:00,1,0,Yes it will reduce the value of gifts over 5mm annually Most people will be able to give tax free But it means wealthiest can t simply decide how their funds get used while everyone else pays taxes into a democratic system It also means big money will be raised for taxes
1402628272484126724,2021-06-09 14:06:54+00:00,0,0,I accept that as an outcome It can t be that certain groups families escape taxes forever A lifetime seems long enough
1402625035022577667,2021-06-09 13:54:02+00:00,1,0,A wealth tax will reduce total taxable income over time because of sales and will impact valuations for everyone because of forced selling The 3 point plan I suggest creates MORE revenue over time though I acknowledge it will take generations to fully capture

1402358967951577098,2021-06-08 20:16:47+00:00,0,0,driver At some point my views is everyone should pay taxes At death at a minimum That s part of the fairness issue It can t be that the taxes are avoided for generations If at death the business needs to be sold or loans need to be taken to pay the tax bill that is the cost
1402358125425049605,2021-06-08 20:13:26+00:00,0,0,driver I m generally in favor but probably for individuals over a certain wealth threshold so as to still provide an investment incentive for middle class I do worry a bit about lock in effect on investment as a result higher tax rate but I don t have a great solution for that
1402334764745564167,2021-06-08 18:40:36+00:00,0,0,Agreed There should be a public policy debate about why the country decided to incentive such borrowing But also worth noting I m pretty sure Buffett isn t living off of any loans And Bezos regularly sells stock pays tax on it So there must be other deductions
1402331249604169728,2021-06-08 18:26:38+00:00,10,0,missing word eliminating step up in basis at death
1402331011183267843,2021-06-08 18:25:41+00:00,0,0,yes eliminating step up
1402330821063815168,2021-06-08 18:24:56+00:00,1,0,i get it i m not sure you can prevent people taking loans against assets but you could limit the incentive in place that allows for interest expense deductions
1402326286496899073,2021-06-08 18:06:55+00:00,1,0,how do you fund your life with unrealized capital gains the only way i know how to do that would be to borrow against stock the fix as i ve been arguing for over a decade is to fix the step up in basis on the estate tax and limit interest expenses as deductions
1402325431253090311,2021-06-08 18:03:31+00:00,13,0,I don t misunderstand it purposely or not And you just made my point for me The piece doesn t present the information in a balanced way It purposely frames the information to make a very specific point And that s a fair thing to do But that s an opinion column
1402321550678835200,2021-06-08 17:48:06+00:00,68,2,The tax debate shouldn t be ideological How much do we need to raise for our current needs Do we care about paying off debt How can the policy be made to feel fair All that should be weighed w creating more jobs growth what incentives are necessary to create virtuous cycle
1402321549512880134,2021-06-08 17:48:05+00:00,54,2,I ve also long argued that step up in basis at death is critical to make estate taxes work the way they are intended It would also eliminate some of the incentive for the wealthy to borrow against their holdings There should also be a greater limit on interest deductions
1402321548082565130,2021-06-08 17:48:05+00:00,35,3,I ve long argued for a series of changes to the tax code to capture a much larger portion of taxes from the wealthy arguably more than a wealth tax if structured properly including possibly taxing philanthropy among the richest
1402321538414694405,2021-06-08 17:48:03+00:00,39,3,then to understand exactly what deductions were used to show losses if the bill was zero Then there is a good and solid public policy debate to be had about how all this works or doesn t
1402321535025745925,2021-06-08 17:48:02+00:00,74,8,People pay taxes on realized gains not simply on gains in stocks that have not been sold There seems to be a strange apples vs oranges idealogical thing going on here The apples vs apples comparison would be to look at their income in a given year vs the tax paid and
1402321532978860043,2021-06-08 17:48:01+00:00,38,7,The piece which includes some spectacular reporting in getting access to the tax information that has long been off limits from the public makes an unusual decision in comparing the tax bill of these billionaires against their gains in total wealth on paper
1402321531892555778,2021-06-08 17:48:01+00:00,113,24,A couple of thoughts about this piece from on the taxes paid or not in this case by the wealthiest Americans that is getting a lot of attention today

1355943318849540097,2021-01-31 18:17:34+00:00,12,0,I agree Any good protest should be changing things I want to to fix the system and level playing field What I m trying to understand is whether the traditional views of investor protections should be rethought
1355941342610862083,2021-01-31 18:09:42+00:00,18,0,agree let s figure out ways everyone has same opportunity but we have to do it in a way that doesn t allow for predators to take advantage casinos don t allow you bet on margin and the state won t give you a loan to buy a lottery ticket

1355905485619286017,2021-01-31 15:47:13+00:00,21,1,Not at all Currently the law doesn t all you to invest in early stage startups and other investments deemed high risk without being accredited which is currently equated with wealth What I m saying is about leveling playing field

1344341660650639363,2020-12-30 17:56:43+00:00,0,1,tx I m thrilled and grateful for the work of Moderna But make no mistake Taxpayers funded that work And therefore front line workers should benefit first The board and their families have already gotten their economic benefit
1344314035127394305,2020-12-30 16:06:56+00:00,1,0,I would agree if it is done publicly That would instill confidence That s one of the reasons for disclosure But Company says it will be confidentially So it is clearly not part of a confidence campaign
1344296187441131525,2020-12-30 14:56:01+00:00,0,0,Mackovak If taxpayers funded it and the board members and their family were getting the medicine before people who needed it yes this would be an issue
1344281645738811392,2020-12-30 13:58:14+00:00,213,21,It makes more sense for a doctor s family to get vaccinated than a Moderna board member We need doctors working on front lines If their spouses or kids are sick doctor can t work that s bad public policy
1344280279410683904,2020-12-30 13:52:48+00:00,11,1,tx Please explain how vaccinating board members and their families have anything to do with continuity of supply Are they in the lab On trucks
1344279835527569408,2020-12-30 13:51:02+00:00,2,0,Agree But you need disclosure for that to happen and Moderna says they won t disclose who is getting and who is not
1344279293317279746,2020-12-30 13:48:53+00:00,0,0,tx Yes Totally agree But they won t disclose which board members and family members will take it So the idea of using the opportunity to build public confidence which would have been a reasonable argument isn t happening
1344278105167441920,2020-12-30 13:44:10+00:00,282,46,Disclosure please Our tax dollars helped fund tx vaccine Board amp family members are jumping line over front line workers Public should know who exactly is jumping line Massive gift likely valued upwards six figures on black market Moderna is public company
1344274913029476354,2020-12-30 13:31:29+00:00,1,0,Our tax dollars helped fund vaccine The board amp family members are jumping line over front line workers Public should know which board members are taking it Disclosure to the public investors of massive gift to them worth six figure on black market Moderna is public company

1344093647118200832,2020-12-30 01:31:12+00:00,0,0,Agree That s why they should disclose The purpose of allowing board members amp their families ahead of front line workers should be to boost confidence Otherwise it is a gift ie comp The value of jumping the line could be valued in the 5 to 6 figure range in market
1344065168838455296,2020-12-29 23:38:02+00:00,3,1,The drug was developed using your tax dollars I m thrilled Moderna pulled it off and I m thankful to them But board members are not more essential than front line workers And because this vaccine was part of a govt program this very much is all our business
1344064267117584384,2020-12-29 23:34:27+00:00,1,0,Not really fair for board members to skip line and jump ahead of front line workers for drug that was developed with help of tax dollars The cost of line jumping should be disclosure
1344062923052879884,2020-12-29 23:29:06+00:00,7,0,Correct They said it is voluntary confidential Given those on front lines board members shouldn t qualify unless it is part of a public campaign to reduce vaccine hesitancy Hence need for disclosure While I hope they all want to take it if some don t I d want to know
1344061333847896065,2020-12-29 23:22:48+00:00,337,56,Since Moderna is giving vaccine to executives board members they should disclose which ones take it which ones don t It would be great if all of them do as show of faith If some don t public should know This could fall under SEC disclosure rules as form of compensation

1335759568685699076,2020-12-07 01:34:33+00:00,0,0,You re not wearing a mask at an indoor restaurant nor are other diners Airlines require masks If everyone on the airline decided to eat at the same time there would be elevated risks too though airplanes do have better air circulation than most restaurants
1335754190661046282,2020-12-07 01:13:10+00:00,1,0,My feeling is that it undermined his credibility But he did cop to his failure explaining his worry that health workers wouldn t have access to masks if the public ran out bought them up I appreciated his effort to explain but I don t have sympathy for not being straight
1335752390532878336,2020-12-07 01:06:01+00:00,2,0,what s enclosed when i could look directly up at the sky i wasn t in the tent behind me and i said so why knowingly misrepresent what i said
1335751815737057280,2020-12-07 01:03:44+00:00,3,0,I agree with you one of the greatest failures of this pandemic up there with lack of early testing
1335748586911444993,2020-12-07 00:50:54+00:00,1,0,lots and lots of testing crew was masked and distanced anchors were masked when not on air
1335748128331468802,2020-12-07 00:49:05+00:00,1,0,the scenario i discussed different than the one you just posited you said no masks at either restaurant or big box i said no mask at restaurant required masks at big box big difference
1335747288543748096,2020-12-07 00:45:45+00:00,6,0,do you purposely misrepresent what i say all i said was that indoor dining is higher risk that masked big box store dining outdoors totally different of course as positivity rate goes up especially in places like utah where it is 19 risks goes up wherever you are
1335745530304061443,2020-12-07 00:38:46+00:00,46,0,I agree we are constantly learning more But goal posts haven t moved The active efforts to spread disinformation about masking and the politicization of the pandemic created misunderstanding to this day and yes continued deaths

1280530406358552576,2020-07-07 15:53:34+00:00,28,1,Rule could be simple If you want in person school you must participate in regular testing If not you can learn by us
1280523637557276673,2020-07-07 15:26:40+00:00,13,0,Why not Harvard Cornell NBA and MLB all plan to do so We have spent trillions on business but not our kids The investment would pay for itself because it would mean a safer community and healthier economy
1280521904814727169,2020-07-07 15:19:47+00:00,5,2,Phil The issue isn t necessarily the risk COVID poses to children alone the issue is whether they act as spreaders to teachers bus drivers janitors parents and grandparents Unfortunately the science on that is not clear That s why reopening schools is such a tricky issue
1280519307882045450,2020-07-07 15:09:28+00:00,5,0,Maybe the answer especially at high school level is for all the students to wear N95s and teachers wear face shields all in concert w robust regular testing More complicated at younger ages for mask compliance That s why those teachers may need to be in N95s themselves
1280499516509126662,2020-07-07 13:50:49+00:00,17,0,adelson You don t need to daily And you could do a less invasive spit test plans to test every three days plans to do tests every week is testing every other day Why not good enough for everyone else
1280497608306368515,2020-07-07 13:43:14+00:00,1,0,There are good tests that require simply spitting Not invasive at all And what looks like a healthy person can be an asymptomatic spreader
1280497236204490760,2020-07-07 13:41:46+00:00,1,0,Operative word is safely You don t think we all would like school to reopen if it can be done safely for kids teachers and the community If we can t agree that is a fair goal
1280488653765120000,2020-07-07 13:07:40+00:00,2,0,What s a healthy person look like There are lots of asymptomatic people who feel healthy but are spreading COVID to others So yes testing everyone regularly That s always been the goal Until then WearAMask
1280488171579588608,2020-07-07 13:05:45+00:00,13,1,I m with you 100 percent We just don t know enough about this dreaded virus yet I said assuming low risk because that seems to be the conventional wisdom rightly or wrongly and my point is we need to test PPE even if that is the case
1280487466034761731,2020-07-07 13:02:56+00:00,1,0,It is expensive Most states can t afford to do this on their own It s the same reason the states didn t provide PPP loans to small businesses To your point perhaps Fed money could be granted to states to use for school testing PPE
1280485189303570433,2020-07-07 12:53:54+00:00,7,0,C mon Read the article you just posted Testing and PPE are not even mentioned

1280461097967988737,2020-07-07 11:18:10+00:00,180,29,joe Teachers are essential But kids are a contact sport If we want to treat teachers like front line workers public private schools should provide PPE N95 s robust testing since compliance will be hard for kids I havent t heard school reopening advocates pushing for either
1280454468237131776,2020-07-07 10:51:49+00:00,4,1,Mnuchin shamed many companies for taking the loans and some returned the money So you should ask him My view is a job is a job is a job I would have simply provided 0 interest loans to everybody with a separate application process to have them forgiven based on need later
