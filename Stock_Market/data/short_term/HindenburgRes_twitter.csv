1341403681070170116,2020-12-22 15:22:14+00:00,30,5,In fact overzealous MVIS shareholders had a coup of sorts during a May 12 2020 Microsoft webinar in which they forced a Microsoft PR rep to deny that it was buying MVIS Regardless these perpetual buyout rumors are a factor in the stock s meteoric rise
1341403677966413824,2020-12-22 15:22:13+00:00,23,3,Adding to this a chorus of second tier blogs have pushed the narrative that the company could be acquired by Microsoft or other tech giants an extremely unlikely proposition given the company s astronomical valuation

1252220616498872322,2020-04-20 13:00:34+00:00,0,0,The new administration has publicly accused the previous Minister of Mines of corruption specifically relating to his dealings with NUAG s Bolivian subsidiary Alcira
1252220614712217600,2020-04-20 13:00:34+00:00,0,0,NUAG had a strong relationship with the Bolivian government when it acquired its mining concessions which seemingly enabled it to bypass the law However in late 2019 the friendly administration was ousted via coup with the President and Minister of Mines fleeing to Mexico
1252220613252583424,2020-04-20 13:00:33+00:00,0,0,Our review of NUAG s Bolivian deals shows that the mining concessions on its flagship property had previously been stripped from their previous holder by the state amp were never fully restored leaving the property in a state of legal limbo
1252220612090740748,2020-04-20 13:00:33+00:00,0,0,All of NUAG s deals in Bolivia seem to violate laws on the purchase sale of concessions Unlike in the U S and Canada Bolivia does not permit the sale or transfer of mining concessions privately Each deal requires state approval

1251151434545954822,2020-04-17 14:12:01+00:00,12,1,Obviously we believe the Covid 19 hype surrounding WORX is completely bogus and we predict shares will soon return to the 2 25 price level they were at prior to the hype
1251151432440442886,2020-04-17 14:12:01+00:00,13,0,Meanwhile the buyer that WORX has lined up for up to 840M dollars in tests is a virtual healthcare company started by a 25 year old in August 2018 that looks modestly sized hardly the partner that would be capable of handling hundreds of millions of dollars in orders

1244617660215803904,2020-03-30 13:29:08+00:00,21,2,On Friday we pointed out that PRED falsely claimed its Chinese COVID 19 test manufacturing partner Dablood pharma was approved in China to sell test kits In fact Dablood publicly posted a letter 5 days ago saying it planned to apply for approval
1243525517992767494,2020-03-27 13:09:21+00:00,7,0,PRED s financials suggest to us that the company is months if not weeks away from insolvency We see 100 near term downside in shares of Predictive and expect that Predictive must continue to dilute equity through near term stock sales in order to survive
1243525515073523712,2020-03-27 13:09:21+00:00,4,1,PRED s CEO has previously been sued over claims of non compliant marketing of a medical product amp claims of falsely stating that his product would be pitched by Dr Oz amp the Gates Foundation PRED s former Chairman had been charged by the SEC on allegations of issuing false PRs
1243525512758284288,2020-03-27 13:09:20+00:00,0,0,Instead multiple investigative reporters in China have exposed that Dablood s COVID 19 tests have been sold in China without medical or production licenses which is illegal One reporter specifically mentioned that the conduct was suspected to be fraudulent PRED
1243525510551998464,2020-03-27 13:09:19+00:00,0,0,But contrary to PRED s press release which calls its partner one of very few companies approved by the Chinese government we found that Dablood is NOT an approved manufacturer of COVID 19 tests in China

1079014574827933696,2018-12-29 14:01:36+00:00,117,31,Unbelievable The CEO of GGB let slip in an interview that APHA board member Shawn Dym invested personally in private GGB just months ahead of APHA s own investment This is EXACTLY what we alleged with LatAm and what we alleged with Nuuvera which APHA later admitted
1078676596700127233,2018-12-28 15:38:36+00:00,40,7,We view this APHA offer as non credible and likely an attempt to generate the appearance of demand in the hopes of spurring credible offers A deal would allow for a change of control and a somewhat graceful exit for APHA s tarnished management team
