1604594260761788416,2022-12-18 21:47:38+00:00,263,27,Elon and Jared earlier today
1604593722850689024,2022-12-18 21:45:30+00:00,2,0,PowerMode They are are referring to developed world government bonds
1604593509448781824,2022-12-18 21:44:39+00:00,79,4,The group on the wrong side of the biggest rally in 5 000 years is now betting on a bond rally I m suggesting a textbook contrarian call
1604591298136129540,2022-12-18 21:35:51+00:00,105,7,4 4 These funds managers think a recession will cause the Fed will pivot bonds will soar and liquidity junkie markets will celebrate cheap money over the concern of declining economic activity You have now been warned and have no one to blame but yourself
1604591296462602241,2022-12-18 21:35:51+00:00,63,4,3 4 They also think Govt bonds will be the best performing asset in 2023 top panel previous tweet even better than stocks Why These fund managers expect a recession in 2023
1604591294831116288,2022-12-18 21:35:51+00:00,63,6,2 4 The Dec BofA fund manager survey shows they are now OVERweight bonds for the first time since 09 Restated every minute of the best decade since 3 000 BC to own bonds fund managers were UNDERweight Arguably the worst investment call in the history of organized society
1604591292821929984,2022-12-18 21:35:50+00:00,156,28,1 4 Between 2009 and 2022 central banks QE d markets higher Central Banks so distorted markets that there were 17T negative by 2019 A consequence of this was 2010 to 2020 was the best TOTAL RETURN decade in 5 000 years per this book
1604584316540944385,2022-12-18 21:08:07+00:00,0,0,they re not dead they re resting
1604582643324026880,2022-12-18 21:01:28+00:00,112,5,22 22 This idea that the economy weakens the Fed pivots and markets soar works with inflation of 2 forever 09 to 21 But if inflation is gt 2 forward the worst thing that can happen is the economy weakens enough for the Fed to pivot
1604582641516290052,2022-12-18 21:01:28+00:00,91,3,21 22 Or what was the most successful investing style between 2009 and 2021 Buy broad based equity ETFs and whine that the Fed is not doing enough to make you rich Not only did everyone think this most still believe this
1604582639406616579,2022-12-18 21:01:27+00:00,136,11,20 22 This is what 15 years of QE negative interest rates forward guidance and Fed puts have done The market is all about liquidity It is a junkie for liquidity It is all that matters
1604582637313589250,2022-12-18 21:01:27+00:00,54,2,19 22 Because if your stocks perform by delivering earnings and have to hire more people and God forbid see enough demand for their product that they have to RAISE prices your reward is another wipeout in stock prices as the Fed never pivots
1604582635321364481,2022-12-18 21:01:26+00:00,48,0,18 22 So here we are in 2022 Use all your skill to pick good stocks and hope they lose money and fire people aka a recession Then you will be rewarded with higher stock prices as the Fed pivots
1604582633115189251,2022-12-18 21:01:26+00:00,53,4,17 22 Not to mention paying almost 17x for 2 year out earnings or gt 15x for 3 year out earnings This is very expensive UNLESS discount rates start falling because inflation is returning to 2 forever Not so as a reaction to heading into a recession
1604582630606876672,2022-12-18 21:01:25+00:00,60,5,15 22 So rates have yet to peak How about stocks If rates are going higher then the discount rates used in valuation are also going higher Then paying over 18x for next year s earnings with higher discount rates looks awfully expensive
1604582627549274112,2022-12-18 21:01:24+00:00,57,3,14 22 How about long rates 10 year yield If the economy is not falling apart the curve inversion will stall This should drag the 10 year yield higher green The curve blue already at a 41 year extreme should stay within 100 bps if it even gets that extreme
1604582624781017089,2022-12-18 21:01:24+00:00,66,7,13 22 Short rates the 2 year yield did not peak at 4 72 on Nov 7 Rate hike cycles ended with the 2 year yield ABOVE the terminal peak funds rate If the Fed goes to 5 5 25 history says the 2 year yield peaks above the terminal rate or at least 5 25
1604582622444883970,2022-12-18 21:01:23+00:00,40,0,12 22 So if the pattern continues that Wall Street is too pessimistic or too impatient on their pessimism and does not get its pivot because the economy does not IMMEDIATELY fall apart what does it mean for markets
1604582619882176512,2022-12-18 21:01:22+00:00,52,0,11 22 Instead they are doubling down that jobs are falling apart Their latest rationalization is a big downward revision to Q2 2022 job growth Even if true these revisions are due in Feb 2024 14 months So don t hold your breath
1604582614240821253,2022-12-18 21:01:21+00:00,66,1,10 22 And the payrolls beating 8 times in a row has a record streak and should tell Wall Street something is amiss they are getting the jobs market wrong
1604582611460001794,2022-12-18 21:01:20+00:00,60,0,9 22 So these are the battle lines Who will win Wall Street has been losing to the Fed all year by insisting the Fed would pause then pivot Wall Street has been bearish on jobs Instead payrolls have beaten 11 of the last 12 months including 8 in a row rectangle
1604582608666382336,2022-12-18 21:01:20+00:00,66,4,8 22 And year over year wage growth orange bottom panel is holding around 5 Simply if everyone gets 5 pay raises they can afford 5 inflation 5 inflation is unacceptable
1604582605839822848,2022-12-18 21:01:19+00:00,61,4,7 22 There are 1 7 open jobs for every unemployed person bottom panel
1604582602056388608,2022-12-18 21:01:18+00:00,74,6,6 22 So what does the Fed see causing the fund s rate to stay at 5 125 next year Start with the labor market The simple truth is the jobs market is NOT weakening And the Fed is not changing unless it shows UNMISTAKABLE signs of weakening Initial claims are NOT rising
1604582598919192576,2022-12-18 21:01:17+00:00,66,4,5 22 Additionally economists see the unemployment rate for year end 2023 will now be 4 5 Oct and Nov surveys Note that in May gold line they had it at 3 6 This is a big rise and such an increase only occurs in recessions
1604582595907518465,2022-12-18 21:01:17+00:00,69,6,4 22 And before you conclude that the 63 of ECONOMISTS predicting a recession doesn t count note that the BofA s December Global Fund Managers survey in which 300 FUND MANAGERS participated had nearly an identical response at 68
1604582593021755394,2022-12-18 21:01:16+00:00,65,3,3 22 A similar monthly survey conducted by Bloomberg of about 70 economists shows the probability of a recession is even higher at 63 This survey began in 2008 and the only time it was higher was when the US economy was actually in recession in 2020
1604582590249422849,2022-12-18 21:01:15+00:00,111,8,2 22 So why does the market think the Fed will do much less The latest Philadelphia Federal Reserve quarterly survey of professional forecasters shows the probability of a recession in the next year is the highest in the 50 years this survey has been conducted
1604582587657293830,2022-12-18 21:01:15+00:00,928,247,1 22 As this chart shows there is a big difference between what the market and the Fed think And this divergence will define the first part of 2023 trading A to explain

1602649314039418881,2022-12-13 12:59:06+00:00,152,13,6 6 Other reasons for inflation slowing in Nov Nov Gas prices 7 7 Home prices rents have been weakening so OER s rise is expected to slow These are the same arguments they use every month and nearly every month they forecast too low So I look for CPI to beat
1602649312323928067,2022-12-13 12:59:06+00:00,82,14,5 6 As pointed out above the Cleveland Fed Nowcast is at 0 47 above even the highest economist estimates from the 62 economists above at 0 4 Driving the downward bias in economist inflation forecasts is a 50 year high in predicting a recession is coming
1602649310436409344,2022-12-13 12:59:06+00:00,60,7,4 6 Given all this my reflex has been that CPI will beat or come in above the median forecast of economists The current median estimate from Wall Street is 0 3 down from 0 4 last month
1602649308855209987,2022-12-13 12:59:05+00:00,65,6,3 6 And now as in the last few months economists blue bars diverged even lower bottom panel from the Cleveland Fed s mechanical Nowcast orange line So strong is the belief inflation is falling economists are more willing to stray lower from the Nowcast red bars
1602649307064279040,2022-12-13 12:59:05+00:00,72,8,2 6 This belief causes economists to keep biasing their forecasts downward Consequently inflation blue bars has come below expectations orange line only 4 times since January 2021 22 months as the black rectangle highlights Inflation regularly beats

1596329088355954688,2022-11-26 02:24:47+00:00,360,57,New all time high doubled in the last 10 days A few weeks ago the double rate was 3 4 days Is the growth rate slowing Or is the scale too large to keep up Who knows but videos of officials in hazmat suits beating citizens suggests the govt thinks it is not slowing
1596267666313879553,2022-11-25 22:20:43+00:00,2,0,The only voice that matters is Powell The Fed chairman is a Benevolent Dictator
1596265391021445120,2022-11-25 22:11:41+00:00,3,0,The Fed says neutral should be 50 bps above the inflation rate That puts neutral at 3 5 to 4 5 Powell has said they might have to be tight in the future
1596264731920080896,2022-11-25 22:09:03+00:00,1,0,NPV True but when projecting rates out two years the curve tends to parallel shift He is the forward swap curve for 10 year yields in two years They are pricing 50 bps lower 10 year yields ff 150 bps lower pricing an uninverting of the curve
1596257468425773056,2022-11-25 21:40:12+00:00,1,0,Agree but not before
1596257348296658944,2022-11-25 21:39:43+00:00,1,0,Sure what were you thinking
1596249408454000641,2022-11-25 21:08:10+00:00,219,11,8 8 So one cannot argue the market was cheap anyway if the forward fed funds curve bends to a flat line around 5 This is why the stock market is DESPERATE for a Fed pivot pause step down peak inflation whatever we are calling it this week It is all about rates
1596249406793084929,2022-11-25 21:08:10+00:00,147,12,7 8 SPX FORWARD P E ratio is now 17 84x close to the average pre pandemic level Bear market bottoms have coincided with PE ratios 10x Similarly the tech bust in the early 2000s didn t bottom until valuations hit 14x In all these previous cases rates were lower
1596249405237362688,2022-11-25 21:08:09+00:00,82,1,6 8 When if this happens the stock market has to price in this reality of higher rates and that means lower multiples Why The stock market never reached valuations associated with a bear market low So pricing in a 5 flat line of rates in 2024 will lower multiples
1596249403207008256,2022-11-25 21:08:09+00:00,103,6,5 8 My view I agree inflation has probably peaked But I do not think it s going back to 2 It will stop at 3 4 secular change So I look for the forward FF chart above to bend higher to a flat line near expected terminal rate of 5 into 2024
1596249401021775872,2022-11-25 21:08:08+00:00,98,4,4 8 In other words the market expects lower rates for the good reasons that inflation is NATURALLY returning to 2 not the bad reasons that the economy will be crashing This is why the stock market likes this narrative
1596249399289516034,2022-11-25 21:08:08+00:00,91,10,3 8 And why are 2024 rates lower Because EXPECTED inflation is STILL believed to be transitory and will return to the Fed s preferred target of 2 0 50 shaded This chart shows Wall Street s forecasts colors of Core PCE black the fed s favorite inflation metric

1595221995511128065,2022-11-23 01:05:36+00:00,517,28,13 13 This is why they constantly make policy mistakes They start with a conclusion and blind everyone with words and statistics with the intent of you giving up and trusting them Transitory anyone end
1595221994114789377,2022-11-23 01:05:35+00:00,376,33,12 13 When an indicator does not give the Fed its desired signal they invent a new one that is impossible for muggles to understand This is by design trust the wizards This curve core PCE the quit rate 5y 5y TIPS breakeven rates are some examples
1595221992239558656,2022-11-23 01:05:35+00:00,226,27,11 13 And this curve is NOT inverted and has NOT been persistently inverted So the Fed thinks the yield curve is saying all is well The 3mo 10yr is interesting but not predictive according to the Fed
1595221990670942208,2022-11-23 01:05:35+00:00,226,18,10 13 Powell said in his November 2 press conference this yield curve which he called the near term forward spread is what the Fed focuses on Not the 3mo 10yr curve that has 50 years of research backing it From the presser transcript
1595221989035122688,2022-11-23 01:05:34+00:00,180,13,9 13 Simply it compares today s 3 mo bill rate to the forward curve s expectation of 3 mo bill rate 18 months into the future When inverted it means the 3 mo rate in 18 months is LOWER than the current 3 mo rate Or the current 3 month bill rate is too tight
1595221987189616641,2022-11-23 01:05:34+00:00,257,34,8 13 Underscoring the Fed will stay too tight for too long is they have an entirely different curve they watch And it is not inverted The difference in the current 3 month T bill rate and the rate expected 3 mo bill rate in 18 months Explained here
1595221985662889985,2022-11-23 01:05:33+00:00,341,30,7 13 Does this mean the Fed will pivot as the curve says it is too tight History says no as the Fed HAS NOT DAMAGED ANYTHING YET per the curve So the Fed will stay this way for months and the cumulative damage of tight policy breaks mkts and or causes a recession
1595221984102580224,2022-11-23 01:05:33+00:00,336,57,6 13 Here is a chart of the 3mo 10yr curve Shaded are recessions red is inversion Inversion leads recessions without fail In Sept 1998 the yield curve inverted on only 2 different days A recession did not follow Hence the need for a persistence metric like 10 days
1595221982189977600,2022-11-23 01:05:33+00:00,638,158,5 13 And as this table shows when the 3mo 10yr yield curve inverts for 10 consecutive days it is 8 for 8 in predicting recessions over the last 50 years The average lead time is 311 days or about 10 months
1595221980482916352,2022-11-23 01:05:32+00:00,254,20,4 13 There is nothing magical about 10 days Rather it is a way to say the curve is inverted and staying that way This is when the signal becomes important Other such measures of persistent inversion will yield the same readings

1590381696855470080,2022-11-09 16:31:59+00:00,173,12,9 10 The problem is centralized exchanges brokers They are inherently unstable and prone to blow up They do in tradfi all the time 2008 2011 MF Global 2020 But they have the central bank money printer and governments with taxing power and large armies to backstop them
1590381695202885633,2022-11-09 16:31:58+00:00,160,6,8 10 For now think of BTC chart as a bet on whether CZ Binance walks away As I write it is breaking below 17k This signals the market is very worried CZ Binance will not acquire FTX
1590381693906882561,2022-11-09 16:31:58+00:00,149,4,7 10 Word is CZ might walk away the problem is too big even for Binance to handle
1590381692543717378,2022-11-09 16:31:58+00:00,148,7,6 10 If not a lot of people read other brokers hedge funds institutional investors in addition to retail degens have FTX accounts and if they cannot get their money out they are in trouble This is one example expect many more examples
1590381691297988611,2022-11-09 16:31:57+00:00,137,5,5 10 The big question now is does CZ Binance follow through and acquire FTX Remember they only signed a NON BINDING letter of Intent subject to due diligence If they do the counter party risk is mitigated
1590381690014552064,2022-11-09 16:31:57+00:00,161,5,4 10 What CZ did not anticipate and is now apparent is how SBF squandered his trust in the industry So at the first sign of trouble everyone ran And they took a CZ s statement of displeasure over SBF and turned it into a wipeout that sunk FTX Alameda in two days
1590381688474869760,2022-11-09 16:31:57+00:00,145,4,3 10 So when it came to light that sketchy things were going on between FTX and Alameda CZ moved to muzzle SBF to get him to back off on the money he was spreading around DC to personally write the crypto bill
1590381686688129024,2022-11-09 16:31:56+00:00,197,14,2 10 I think this is an honest assessment My take CZ was pissed like many at FTX for bullying Congress to write the crypto bill to favor FTX and against the larger crypto industry CZ wanted to embarrass SBF not kill him off in this manner

1590062569011949568,2022-11-08 19:23:53+00:00,29,1,This is why it is CENTRALIZED entities like Celsius and FTX that fail Move to fully reserved borrowing lending like AAVE and liquidity pool model of trading like Uniswap and a lender of last resort CB is no longer needed
1590061893347332096,2022-11-08 19:21:11+00:00,15,0,I would argue the causation is backward CBs are needed because the structure of banking fractional reserves and brokerage rehypothecation will always be unstable and subject to failure and bailouts

1588232510986719233,2022-11-03 18:11:53+00:00,69,4,5 5 Of course anything is possible with one monthly number But something that would be consistent with this such a downtick in jobs would be a surge in initial unemployment claims As the following chart shows claims are NOT surging they have been falling since July
1588232509778587649,2022-11-03 18:11:52+00:00,50,4,4 5 In other words Wall Street has convinced itself that tomorrow s number Oct will see a material downtick from last month Sept Again this big downtick is from the crowd that has been too low with their forecasts in 10 of the last 12 months
1588232508394672128,2022-11-03 18:11:52+00:00,35,2,3 5 Oct s guess of 195k would be the lowest since the loss in Dec 2020 blue bars above Also of the 73 guesses this month only one is above last month s Sept result of 288k The other 72 estimates are 270k to 80k
1588232507107037185,2022-11-03 18:11:52+00:00,51,4,2 5 The consensus for Oct payrolls is 195k range of 300k to 80k 73 guesses As the following chart shows in 10 of the last 12 months the results beat the median forecast green bars bottom panel Restated job growth has beaten the estimates in 10 of the last 12 months

1587962516847591435,2022-11-03 00:19:01+00:00,166,33,Regarding point 2 The blue line is the terminal funds rate where the Fed stops using the FF futures is now 5 10 Or the Fed goes to 5 00 5 25 by spring 2023 bottom panel Restated the Fed has another 150 bps of hiking More if the terminal rate does not peak soon
1587960390746767360,2022-11-03 00:10:34+00:00,74,9,4 4 Note the Cleveland Fed estimate for core inflation orange line top panel chart immediately above is the highest for the entire cycle at 0 54 for Oct This estimate looks for core inflation to accelerate And remember the actual result typically beats this estimate
1587960388980727808,2022-11-03 00:10:34+00:00,45,7,3 4 Same chart as above but for core inflation The actual result blue bars top panel has beaten the last Nowcast estimate orange line top panel for 10 of the last 12 months red bard bottom panel October is estimated at 0 54
1587960386955137024,2022-11-03 00:10:33+00:00,60,4,2 4 The actual result blue bars top has beaten the last nowcast estimate orange line top for 18 of the last 20 months bottom Aug 21 and Jul 22 red bars bottom panel are the 2 months the actual was less than the last nowcast estimate Oct is estimated at 0 78
1587960384996216837,2022-11-03 00:10:33+00:00,143,36,1 4 Actually the Cleveland Fed Nowcast has been too low The actual results have consistently beaten this estimate So expect these estimates to again be too low These estimates might be a floor more

1587798049325293568,2022-11-02 13:25:29+00:00,193,24,2 3 In other words a 75 bps hike today is a non event The market should not move on this red headline It is all about December Will they hike 75 on Dec 14 for a 5th consecutive meeting The market is going into this 50 50 So it has no idea and is ready to react

1578854067983745024,2022-10-08 21:05:18+00:00,363,48,12 13 Bottom line what Waller told you is the Fed will pivot after our portfolios are rekted we lost our jobs and we all lost hope If you think something abstract that doesn t impact you like British pensions will cause a pivot and a monster stock rally think again
1578854066683543552,2022-10-08 21:05:17+00:00,183,15,11 13 Should the Fed restrict RRP or limit it currently limited to 160B per firm remember Money Market Funds are HUGE This would cause ST rates to fall They don t want that they want to they want the banks to jack up deposit rates They want to cool inflation
1578854065278455808,2022-10-08 21:05:17+00:00,305,28,10 13 What Waller is saying is the bank deposit rate of 0 20 says to him the banks have plenty of liquidity If they did not they would be jacking rates up a lot So shut up about a pivot
1578854063516848128,2022-10-08 21:05:17+00:00,204,24,9 13 How does the RRP flow back into banks Raise deposit rates to compete with RRP But as this chart shows they are not The avg bank deposit rate is still just 0 20 The avg money market fund is 2 28 thanks to nearly half its assets in RRP
1578854062208225280,2022-10-08 21:05:16+00:00,227,28,8 13 Waller is saying if liquidity is bad and it is these RRP in money market funds can flow back into the banks and re liquify them So don t whine to the Fed to pivot THEY DO NOT NEED TO Liquidity exists within the financial system just not in banks
1578854060836651008,2022-10-08 21:05:16+00:00,162,12,7 13 This gets to Waller s comment from last week in the first thread Waller the markets are handing us 2 2 trillion of liquidity they do not need This is a reference to the 2 2 trillion in RRP
1578854059410276360,2022-10-08 21:05:16+00:00,157,12,6 13 Finally it is also important to note these are non bank assets These funds are NOT held by banks but just outside the banking system in money market funds
1578854057732898816,2022-10-08 21:05:15+00:00,219,30,5 13 So as these SEC filings show 92 of RRP is held by Money Market funds left and 8 by Home Loan Banks In fact 44 of all the assets in money market funds is RRP 2 2T of 5 1T of all assets right Yes about half the assets in a typical Money Market Fund are RRP
1578854056478801920,2022-10-08 21:05:15+00:00,225,23,4 13 Who does this AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT SO MANY MISS It is NOT the banks 0 RRP is in banks Why RRP is 3 05 and Interest on the reserves IOR is 3 15 Banks get a better deal parking their reserves with the Fed at IOR 3 15 than RRP at 3 05
1578854054671052801,2022-10-08 21:05:14+00:00,181,16,3 13 Why so popular Simply they offer a competitive rate blue line at 3 05 20 bps below the top of the FF range and the safest counter party in the world NY Fed Why not park your money with the NY Fed with little hassle zero counter party risk and good rates
1578854052947189760,2022-10-08 21:05:14+00:00,230,36,2 12 RRP is simply it is an overnight loan from the NY Fed lender or a Reverse Repurchase For the financial institution borrower it is a Repurchase agreement known as a repo As the chart shows there is currently 2 2 trillion of these loans up from 0 in Jan 2021
1578854051433041920,2022-10-08 21:05:14+00:00,1378,423,1 12 Lots of confusion about the Fed s Reverse Repurchase Program RRP What is it What does it mean Waller s comments from a few days ago are important and will be addressed later in this thread No pivot EVER h t

1566184377649856513,2022-09-03 22:00:28+00:00,3,1,I explained this in the thread the higher price is the rationing this is how it is done So they already have rationing again the price is the rationing mechanism
1566183834303045632,2022-09-03 21:58:19+00:00,3,0,Why
1566180448505675776,2022-09-03 21:44:51+00:00,430,26,15 15 Because the cost has already happened it cannot be undone
1566180447507431424,2022-09-03 21:44:51+00:00,378,41,14 15 So this is about the cost of energy And this is critically important for manufacturing And the costs Europe is now looking at are going to hurt
1566180446014251008,2022-09-03 21:44:51+00:00,349,20,13 15 Unfortunately too many go along with this flawed thinking It is not about the number of molecules available but the price of those molecules Price is how capitalist systems ration Soaring prices mean it will cost a lot more to get it
1566180444999139331,2022-09-03 21:44:50+00:00,336,23,12 15 So what does this all mean Europe has all the gas it needs as long as they drain their bank accounts to pay for it akin to Ferrari makes all the supercars the world needs as long as you have 500k to pay for one
1566180443753529344,2022-09-03 21:44:50+00:00,450,51,11 15 None of this should be a surprise Putin gave a speech in June saying he was going to do this In this case he told us what was coming and now he s doing it
1566180442281312259,2022-09-03 21:44:50+00:00,306,24,10 15 And make no mistake Putin knows all of this which is why he is trolling Europe with leaks requiring a shutdown of NordStream for an unspecified period of time
1566180441228468225,2022-09-03 21:44:50+00:00,254,24,9 15 I pointed out NordStream above as its flow is now zero daily chart below So the orange part above will go to zero in the coming days dropping gas already depressed gas flows to Europe by another 50
1566180440104439814,2022-09-03 21:44:49+00:00,327,35,8 15 But gas flows from Russia are down more than 75 from a normal flow Note the largest part of this chart is NordStream orange And also this chart is a rolling 10 day chart
1566180439072690178,2022-09-03 21:44:49+00:00,284,25,7 15 So Europe still needs flows from Russia this winter and every winter until they have another CHEAP source Before the Ukraine war Germany got about 55 of its gas needs from Russia This has been lowered somewhat in recent months
1566180438019809280,2022-09-03 21:44:49+00:00,278,21,6 15 Also note the natural gas storage detailed above only covers about 25 to 30 of winter natural gas needs seasonal space heating This percentage might be higher this year given the reductions in usage already implemented and proposed
1566180436694417411,2022-09-03 21:44:48+00:00,317,28,5 15 This extra cost which has ALREADY happened will be borne by their population directly soaring energy bill or indirectly through higher taxation for bailouts
1566180435557814274,2022-09-03 21:44:48+00:00,395,46,4 15 Consequently the cost of filling storage this year has already cost more than 6 5x to sill storage in any other FULL season which extends to November 1 They have it and paid HUGE for it
1566180434454650882,2022-09-03 21:44:48+00:00,366,32,3 15 Too many have pointed to the chart above and proclaimed there is no problem here But this neglects the enormous cost it has taken to fill these facilities As the next chart shows European natural gas prices are soaring even after this week s decline
1566180433284534276,2022-09-03 21:44:48+00:00,341,27,2 15 Natural gas is used for power electricity generation and space heating highly seasonal Storage is filled in the summer and run down in the winter for space heating Currently storage facilities are 81 full about the middle of the range seen over the last 5 years

1565666246338691072,2022-09-02 11:41:36+00:00,69,8,6 7 Non callable bonds have positive convexity This means that durations get really long more sensitive to interest rates as rates fall And for the first time in 5 000 years interest rates were negative though to be impossible before 2010 So little no coupon income
1565666245101363200,2022-09-02 11:41:36+00:00,62,3,5 7 Bond market total return is driven by three things 1 Duration how much do bond prices move given an immediate 1 move in their interest rate 2 Convexity how much does the duration change when the interest rate changes 3 Coupon how much interest income
1565666244006739969,2022-09-02 11:41:35+00:00,75,10,4 7 So why is this the worst bond market total return loss excluding credit in 5 000 years of interest rate data And yes there is data that goes back to 3000 BC

1560654198051524608,2022-08-19 15:45:31+00:00,311,39,11 11 So stop waiting for a 2019 return to normal This is normal Your post pandemic economy Pre pandemic models are failing which is why no one saw inflation coming Figure out the post pandemic rules When you do you ll see inflation is real and persistent
1560654196835491841,2022-08-19 15:45:30+00:00,147,10,10 11 If a pre pandemic economy return does NOT return and we believe it will not then the forecasts above will again prove to be too optimistic about the future of inflation and easing of monetary policy

1546128391413407744,2022-07-10 13:45:08+00:00,67,7,2 2 2nd FWIW the cargurus index compiled from 1M website LIST PRICES finished June at a new high and is up over 8k in 18 mos Yes it is LIST PRICES so everyone that wants to see a slowdown will argue this should be ignored But it projects used car CPI as well as Manheim
1546128389685272579,2022-07-10 13:45:08+00:00,89,21,1 2 FWIW since Dec 2020 the Manheim Index orange jump way ahead of similar used car metrics Now it is falling back to the avg of these other measures Also note that used car prices are way ahead of new cars Is Manheim correcting an overdone or signaling a downturn

1545659858510352385,2022-07-09 06:43:21+00:00,11,0,Yes but if you assume the data has a consistent error then the relative position matters But this I mean a 41 year high CPI at 8 6 matters more than the absolute level

1545471547711934465,2022-07-08 18:15:05+00:00,98,11,5 5 Only once Aug 2021 in the last 16 months has the median estimate been a miss red Ten have been beats green and 5 have been equal to the estimate zero If June CPI again beats the 1 1 estimate does the 4 probability for a 100 bps hike on July 27 shoot over 50
1545471546394918916,2022-07-08 18:15:04+00:00,63,3,4 5 So could the same happen this month June CPI median estimate from a Bloomberg of 41 economists YoY 8 8 range 8 1 to 8 9 MoM 1 1 range 0 6 to 1 3
1545471544989736962,2022-07-08 18:15:04+00:00,76,4,3 5 Two trading days later and a blue horseshoe likes 75 story in the WSJ and the probability of a 75 bps hike went from 4 to 94 Two days after that the Fed did hike by 75 bps
1545471543760887808,2022-07-08 18:15:04+00:00,84,5,2 5 Could the Fed really hike by a 100 bps on July 27 Why not Last month the Fed abandoned forward guidance telegraphing their move and hiked 75 bps Remember last month right before the May CPI report beat of 1 0 MoM the probability of a 75 bps hike was also 4
1545471542313852928,2022-07-08 18:15:03+00:00,256,50,1 5 Fed funds probability update using FF futures July 27 now 1 50 1 75 75 bps hike 2 25 2 50 96 100 bps hike 2 50 2 75 4 Sept 21 2 25 2 50 going in 50 bps hike to 2 75 3 00 100 75 bps hike to 3 00 3 25 28 100 bps hike to 3 25 3 20 1
1545455267130769408,2022-07-08 17:10:23+00:00,55,2,This is really disappointing Irwin and Brown should know enough by now to tell the difference between nominal and real growth
1545453754354438146,2022-07-08 17:04:22+00:00,1,0,No it updates with new data
1545453546526605314,2022-07-08 17:03:33+00:00,3,0,victor7 The implications are massively higher interest rates
1545424194145509376,2022-07-08 15:06:55+00:00,12,0,technically correct but you get the same answer
1545423822475694080,2022-07-08 15:05:26+00:00,17,1,Yes and that rate is near 11
1545421946665549824,2022-07-08 14:57:59+00:00,339,46,3 3 Current CPI inflation through May is 8 6 and the consensus for June per Bloomberg is this rises again to 8 8 So the real question is will 300k job growth produce more than 8 8 nominal growth Measures such as the Atlanta Fed GDPnow say the answer is no
1545421945365303296,2022-07-08 14:57:58+00:00,293,37,2 3 In the 1970s when inflation was high recessions started with positive payroll growth especially in 1973 See the orange boxes Inflation was so high that positive payroll growth was not enough to push nominal growth above inflation So can we be in recession now Sure
1545421944178212864,2022-07-08 14:57:58+00:00,526,106,1 3 A recession is nominal before inflation growth is less than inflation For the last 40yrs inflation was so low that nominal growth had to be negative for a recession So a narrative is developing that positive payrolls mean we cannot be in recession This is not true
1545403638134317056,2022-07-08 13:45:14+00:00,1,1,haku The market has only been up 2 of the last 13 weeks This ties the 120 year record of futility For the last three months FinTwit has been looking for a tradeable bottom or to buy the dip This thinking has led to nothing but losses Dip buyers have roasted themselves
1545397416790315008,2022-07-08 13:20:30+00:00,2,0,haku When was the last one
1545397171318673409,2022-07-08 13:19:32+00:00,7,0,Doesn t matter The Fed s priority is inflation Growth is not This was enough to keep max hawkishness on the table 8 6 inflation is worse than a recession
1545391203365126147,2022-07-08 12:55:49+00:00,465,42,Good news jobs is bad news for stocks ES fut is 0 9 34 points NDX fut 1 5 The Fed only has one tool to get you stop buying stuff to cool demand and bring down inflation electrocute your brokerage account This report tells the Fed is turn up the voltage
1545239606546808833,2022-07-08 02:53:26+00:00,0,0,That has not been the case recently At this point let s wait for the number
1545121572175978496,2022-07-07 19:04:24+00:00,1,0,The qualifier once inflation moderates matters more When will this happen and by how much Remember that nearly everyone with an answer for this has been wrong too timid So explain why they were wrong and why now it will finally moderate enough to cut rates
1545052450851237889,2022-07-07 14:29:44+00:00,103,5,4 4 In other words last month s upside payrolls surprise sparked the realization that the door was open for more Fed hawkishness This could also be a risk tomorrow should the report come in at or above the median forecast
1545052447902535682,2022-07-07 14:29:43+00:00,71,2,3 4 Last month saw May payrolls come in at 390k versus a median forecast of 318k Between this release on June 3 and June 16 which also encompassed May s surprisingly high CPI number the S amp P 500 lost 10 8
1545052444991754241,2022-07-07 14:29:43+00:00,83,6,2 4 But it also gives the Fed an opening to continue with its aggressive policy It would not only cement a 75 basis point hike for later this month but would also open the door to even more aggressive moves in September
1545052441648832512,2022-07-07 14:29:42+00:00,196,43,1 4 As the graphic below shows the median forecast for payrolls is 268k with estimates ranging from 90k to 400k If tomorrow s release is close to this estimate it will be thought of as good news from an economic standpoint

1543391543138074624,2022-07-03 00:29:53+00:00,25,0,GDP is released July 29 two days after the Fed persumably hikes by 75 so that should be fun Therefore July 1 is 28 days before the release date Hatizus Goldman is not allowed to call a recession before it has started The political blowback is too great
1543390672320856064,2022-07-03 00:26:25+00:00,72,5,3 3 A committee member told me they often know months or a year before a recession has begun ended They wait for the final data to get the exact start and end dates correct They view their job not to call recessions as that is often known but to get the dates correct
1543390670802526211,2022-07-03 00:26:25+00:00,38,2,2 3 The committee understands that the date matters to the academic community and these dates can never ever ever be revised So they wait until all the final data and revisions are in before they make the call
1543390669238059008,2022-07-03 00:26:25+00:00,44,5,1 3 The purpose of dating a recession is purely an academic exercise This way research economists have dates to pivot their research around This is why it can take as much as 18 months after a recession starts end dates
1543389536843169793,2022-07-03 00:21:55+00:00,7,0,I think they can and will call it without a job loss But we ll see if it comes to that Related issue we might have one without an inverted yield curve also a first if its happens
1543387286246670338,2022-07-03 00:12:58+00:00,18,0,I ve tweeted many times that I think the recession has already started I ve said that the evidence is so strong that it has already begun that the those that think it has not are the one s that have to make the argument So the script has flipped

1543380179082305536,2022-07-02 23:44:43+00:00,61,6,3 3 Here is my early tweet thread on this topic
1543380176830095360,2022-07-02 23:44:43+00:00,109,18,2 3 I put together this chart from Atlanta Fed GDPnow data back to its inception in Q2 2011 See the horizontal line below at 2 1 in each panel For Q2 GDP to beat 2 1 or more to print a positive result would have to be something not done before
1543380175181725696,2022-07-02 23:44:43+00:00,157,30,1 3 Regarding the idea that actual GDP will beat the latest Atlanta Fed GDPnow forecast by more than 2 1 to prevent consecutive negative quarters Q1 2022 was 1 6
1543326290538815489,2022-07-02 20:10:35+00:00,10,0,For now his public statements have been pretty clear The hikes beatings will continue until inflation morale comes around He ll beat it to death before he stops
1543324123266523136,2022-07-02 20:01:59+00:00,154,15,Bonus Another good and similar take comes this week from Insights authored by Rob Arnott and
1543324121165168646,2022-07-02 20:01:58+00:00,244,14,5 5 If 8 handle CPI hangs around for several more months the Fed has no choice but to stay very aggressive Powell could not be any clearer that unless things get REALLY UGLY he is hiking and hiking and hiking until inflation breaks
1543324119210639361,2022-07-02 20:01:58+00:00,145,5,4 5 Also see the August 2021 CPI middle red bar It was just 0 3 This means we could continue to see another 8 YOY in August if not an uptick from July The same goes for Sept Sept 2021 was just 0 4 Restated 8 CPI could persist well into the NFL regular season
1543324117205663747,2022-07-02 20:01:57+00:00,181,10,3 5 IMO 8 4 is not going to get the Fed to back off So after a second 75bps hike in July probability is more than 80 such a July CPI released in mid August showing 8 4 YoY should keep the conversation about a third consecutive 75bps hike in September very much alive
1543324115024633856,2022-07-02 20:01:57+00:00,149,8,2 5 With 1 day done they have July CPI projected at 0 3 ASSUMING THIS HOLDS FOR THE ENTIRE MONTH what does this mean for the Fed Red bars July 2021 was 0 5 So dropping that for to 0 3 July 2022 only lowers the July YoY CPI to 8 4 But CPI peaked Right
1543324112822706176,2022-07-02 20:01:56+00:00,552,144,1 5 The latest inflation Nowcast from the Cleveland Fed June is projected to be another 1 month like May and the YoY for June is projected at 8 7 a new high the current YoY peak was also May at 8 6
1543272293815799809,2022-07-02 16:36:02+00:00,5,1,
1543271562211622912,2022-07-02 16:33:07+00:00,24,0,GDI replacing product with income is diverging My take because we sent out too many stimmy checks too much deficit spending and the too much QE We massively overinflated income See this in particular see figure 2
1543270510917820416,2022-07-02 16:28:57+00:00,12,0,Following up there is considerable debate even among the NBER cycling dating committee as to whether 2001 was even a recession Currently it is the mildest recession in the last century
1543269226005381121,2022-07-02 16:23:50+00:00,19,0,We have also not had 2 consecutive negative quarters without it being a recession So assuming this happens with positive job growth the NBER cycle dating committee will have a difficult decision on its hands I know a member of the committee I will ask him should it happen
1543268171938930688,2022-07-02 16:19:39+00:00,3,0,Thanks as I detailed to expect a 2 beat to get Q2 GDP above zero has not happened in the 11 year of this measure using the forecasts that are within 30 days of the release
1543267347389186050,2022-07-02 16:16:22+00:00,15,0,See my bonus tweets about nominal v real we don t need negative job losses to be in a recession Just need nominal growth to be less than inflation That can happen with positive job growth
1543266931356192769,2022-07-02 16:14:43+00:00,42,2,Yes a recession is whatever the NBER cycle dating committee says is a recession That said try and find 2 consecutive negative quarters that were NOT part of a recession Hint you will not find an example That is why I think it is a technical definition of a recession
1543265825418842115,2022-07-02 16:10:19+00:00,18,2,They all track each other fairly well If anything Manheim which is actual sales at used car wholesale auctions with an adjustment for mileage and quality has been run ahead of the other two measures
1543264495816040449,2022-07-02 16:05:02+00:00,12,0,Yes please do
1543263525019287554,2022-07-02 16:01:11+00:00,4,0,Correct but until recently a few months ago we have seen a record number of cars sell above listing price No measure to show if this has reversed
1543263178699771906,2022-07-02 15:59:48+00:00,1,0,Manheim ticked higher in mid June We await the final June reading
1543262007285137409,2022-07-02 15:55:09+00:00,182,27,cargurus has a DAILY update of the average listing price for used cars This is made up of millions of listing prices on the internet The last update was June 30 and the average listing is a new all time high at 30 839 This measure shows no peak
1543260554214744064,2022-07-02 15:49:23+00:00,275,26,Bonus 2 That means nominal growth is positive but less than inflation Hence negative real growth and a recession Over the previous decades inflation was so low that the only way we could have a recession was to see negative nominal results This is no longer the case
1543260552021123074,2022-07-02 15:49:22+00:00,182,14,Bonus 1 Remember GDP is real GDP That is AFTER inflation With the large inflation numbers in 1H 2022 we can see positive nominal or BEFORE inflation releases and still be in a recession So yes positive results like retail sales and payrolls can happen in a recession
1543260549768777728,2022-07-02 15:49:22+00:00,181,17,5 5 In fact since 2011 the average error rate between Atlanta Fed GDPnow and actual GDP is miss is 0 3 meaning the average GDP release is worse than this forecast
1543260547143155714,2022-07-02 15:49:21+00:00,204,17,4 5 Other than that we have no example of a 2 beat for any Atlanta Fed GDPnow made within 30 days of the release So a 2 1 forecast is big enough that HISTORY SAYS we should expect a second consecutive negative GDP forecast and the technical definition of a recession
1543260544991461376,2022-07-02 15:49:20+00:00,130,6,3 5 Q2 2020 when the forecast was 35 and the actual was 32 So a beat by 3 Of course this was the unprecedented COVID shutdown of the economy which is not the case now
1543260542755868675,2022-07-02 15:49:20+00:00,158,8,2 5 Has the actual GDP release beaten an Atlanta Fed GDPnow forecast made within 30 days of the GDP release like yesterday s Q2 forecast was by more than 2 Since Atlanta Fed GDPnow was created in 2011 it has only happened once
1543260540167921665,2022-07-02 15:49:19+00:00,742,191,1 5 Atlanta Fed GDPnow was updated on Friday yesterday ISM and construction spending were added Q2 GDP tracking took a huge hit It is now projected to DECLINE by 2 1 Remember Q1 2022 was 1 6
1542899346332581890,2022-07-01 15:54:04+00:00,42,5,Update through June 30
1542898304794730496,2022-07-01 15:49:56+00:00,167,18,5 5 Commodities have been the one silver lining this year from a returns perspective However as the chart below shows the Bloomberg Commodities Index fell considerably in June 10 77 Despite this poor month commods have rarely produced such positive first half of a year
1542898301976076290,2022-07-01 15:49:55+00:00,141,15,4 5 The next chart shows these losses in a slightly different manner The bottom panel highlights the drawdown from the previous peak U S bonds are now 12 1 off their peak This is two or three times larger than most of the drawdowns seen since the 1990s

1532424023250030592,2022-06-02 18:08:52+00:00,1,0,Why do you think this is an issue Fed RRP is the safest instrument one can put in a portfolio
1532400205122912256,2022-06-02 16:34:14+00:00,156,16,25 25 So the Fed is draining money via QT and their RRP is another way to drain reserves possibly creating a double tightening This has never happened at this scale before and we are unsure of its potential impact Bottom line reserves are leaving fast via two drains
1532400203176763395,2022-06-02 16:34:13+00:00,40,2,24 25 An equally concerning consideration is the potential draining of reserves away from banks and into non bank MMMFs RRP drains reserves from the banking system The cash still exists but it has restrictions on its use as collateral in the financial system
1532400201645834244,2022-06-02 16:34:13+00:00,39,3,23 25 Yesterday June 1 the Fed officially started QT They will reduce their balance sheet by 47 5 billion in June ramping up reductions to 95 billion month by September Many correctly fret this tightening will have an adverse impact on the economy and or markets
1532400199800340481,2022-06-02 16:34:12+00:00,23,2,22 25 Assets in money market funds have held up slightly better with a smaller drop when compared to cash in banks
1532400197975818242,2022-06-02 16:34:12+00:00,36,7,21 25 This shift of cash out of banks is already underway Cash balances with banks are falling down 1 trillion since last November
1532400196407246848,2022-06-02 16:34:12+00:00,31,1,20 25 Banks are flush with reserves after 13 years of QE and do not need more cash so they continue to offer near 0 on bank accounts MMMFs are dictated by market rates and the RRP rate MMMFs rates are going up 1 in the next couple of months as the Fed hikes more
1532400194721132546,2022-06-02 16:34:11+00:00,32,4,19 25 As the next chart shows MMMFs blue exceed bank deposit rates orange The spread is the largest margin in years bottom red
1532400192971997184,2022-06-02 16:34:11+00:00,28,0,18 25 What s Next For RRP Even higher levels To date usage of the Fed s RRP has grown because the rate offered is competitive better than many market rates In the coming weeks months we could see cash shift away from bank deposit accounts and toward MMMFs
1532400191302778881,2022-06-02 16:34:10+00:00,31,1,17 25 MMMFs do not technically sell They let securities mature reinvest With the Fed telegraphing more 50 bps hikes coming MMMFs have shortened their maturities bottom panel to get their holdings to mature as fast as possible so they can reinvest at a higher yield
1532400189692157957,2022-06-02 16:34:10+00:00,24,0,16 25 Since only some MMMFs are eligible for the Fed s RRP those that are not eligible have been aggressively bidding for a reduced supply of 1 month T bills Why don t these funds extend maturities to the 3 month bill that is yielding over 1
1532400187192365056,2022-06-02 16:34:09+00:00,27,1,15 25 So why are T bill rates so low The Treasury has cut back on issuance due to a surge of tax payments As the chart below shows the Treasury s daily cash balances aka The Treasury General Account or TGA are elevated
1532400185787179008,2022-06-02 16:34:09+00:00,25,0,14 25 T bills are often a viable option for MMMFs with a similar credit risk as the NY Fed But as the chart above shows the 1 month T bill rate orange is well below the RRP rate
1532400184327553024,2022-06-02 16:34:09+00:00,29,0,13 25 MMMFs can get a 0 80 rate with the NY Fed as the counterparty This rate is the same as conventional ON repo Wall Street counterparty or ON Commerical Paper It makes sense that MMMFs are choosing to park their money at the Fed s RRP over these other options
1532400182532444161,2022-06-02 16:34:08+00:00,25,0,12 25 Banks have a higher rate option via IOR so their usage of the Fed s reverse repo facility is zero That means GSEs effectively account for the other 12 4 of repo holdings
1532400177994252289,2022-06-02 16:34:07+00:00,19,0,11 25 IOR is 0 90 set 10 bps the upper end of the current funds rate now 1 00 IOR is 10 basis points above the RRP rate thick black of 0 80 which is set 20 bps below the upper end of the current federal funds rate
1532400174995324930,2022-06-02 16:34:06+00:00,26,1,10 25 The next chart shows various short term interest rates If 87 6 of all RRP is held by money market funds who owns the other 12 4 See the red line that shows interest on reserves IOR
1532400173007134721,2022-06-02 16:34:06+00:00,25,2,9 25 The next chart looks at the RRP market from a different angle 37 9 of MMMFs assets are RRP with the Fed the highest on record
1532400171753033728,2022-06-02 16:34:06+00:00,27,5,8 25 The next chart shows the 10 largest holders of reverse repo among MMMFs As of April 30 2022 Fidelity held 410B of RRP Vanguard was second with 180B JP Morgan was third with 140B
1532400170524196864,2022-06-02 16:34:05+00:00,26,0,7 25 The black line shows the total reverse repo RRP held by MMMFs The bars further break down this amount by govt prime and tax exempt MMMFs Green bottom shows the percentage of RRP held by MMMFs As of April 30 2022 87 6 of all RRP was held by MMMFs
1532400169303658496,2022-06-02 16:34:05+00:00,30,0,6 25 While the Fed does not offer details on who is using its reverse repo facility MMMFs are required to disclose their holdings in their monthly SEC filings This is shown next
1532400168242401282,2022-06-02 16:34:05+00:00,27,0,5 25 With only 30 possible bidders between the banks and GSEs the majority of last Friday s 99 bids came from money market funds MMMFs
1532400166891823105,2022-06-02 16:34:05+00:00,33,1,4 25 So who is eligible to use this facility The next graphic shows the counterparties are broken down into three categories 15 banks 15 GSEs such as Federal Home Loan banks 104 money market mutual funds run by 31 money market fund complexes like Blackrock
1532400165428019201,2022-06-02 16:34:04+00:00,37,0,3 25 Each day the Fed reports the number of counterparties using the reverse repo facility Last Friday 99 bidders used the facility the highest non quarter or year end measure ever
1532400164006244353,2022-06-02 16:34:04+00:00,49,3,2 25 As the chart below shows the amount of money parked at the Federal Reserve s reverse repo RRP facility topped 2 trillion at the end of last week

1528762511100719106,2022-05-23 15:39:20+00:00,70,4,5 6 This week the CBO is to release its first Budget and Economic Outlook since July 2021 Given how fast rates have risen this year we are hopeful they will update their forecast on net interest expenses that was originally released in December 2020
1528762508886016000,2022-05-23 15:39:19+00:00,84,11,4 6 This has helped keep a lid on the nominal amount of interest the Treasury pays each year As a percentage of GDP interest costs have been very steady for most of the past decade
1528762506709196800,2022-05-23 15:39:19+00:00,82,7,3 6 As yields shot higher most of the Tsy s int rates were locked at auctions in previous years when rates were still low The Tsy will only be paying these higher rates as old debt matures and is rolled over in a new auction
1528762504272289792,2022-05-23 15:39:18+00:00,70,9,2 6 Total interest expenses are going to be a function of both the amount of debt outstanding and the average interest rate being paid by the Treasury Clearly Treasury issuance took a giant leap higher as the pandemic took hold so concerns are growing as interest rates rise
1528762502078677003,2022-05-23 15:39:18+00:00,316,55,1 x How much rising interest rates affecting the interest expenses the Treasury must pay on its debt The answer is not much and the Fed will not let consideration of higher interest costs slow them down from their aggressive rate hiking plans

1527480714970669061,2022-05-20 02:45:56+00:00,10,0,Price controls create shortages It s explained in the retweeted thread
1527479444067188749,2022-05-20 02:40:53+00:00,193,29,Last week I penned this tweet that politicians were panicking about rising gas prices wanted price controls Something that always makes it worse Many replies said it would never pass This was merely for show Well it passed today

1527324789836517376,2022-05-19 16:26:20+00:00,57,8,Bonus So it s not aimed at the equity markets in particular but I think it is one of the avenues through which tighter financial conditions will emerge Translated you are going to lose more money There are serious
1527322961560367104,2022-05-19 16:19:04+00:00,265,27,10 10 Where is the Fed Put the level at which the Fed would reverse course This is the biggest question in mkts now Some on Wall Street believe SPX lt 3 850 We believe the strike price of the put is far lower as inflation and not growth is the Fed s priority
1527322958728794112,2022-05-19 16:19:04+00:00,111,5,9 10 But allowing the economy to sink into recession also has a big political price So we understand the argument that Powell will cave on the inflation fight when growth looks ugly enough even if inflation problems persist
1527322956489056260,2022-05-19 16:19:03+00:00,93,6,8 10 Incumbent approval ratings are very low because of inflation and some Democrats are suggesting price controls So backtracking on the commitment to fight inflation would come with a heavy price
1527322952806502400,2022-05-19 16:19:02+00:00,127,7,7 10 Does Powell really mean what he says about bringing inflation under control Will he really become Volcker 2 0 We believe he will simply because the political consequence of not dealing with inflation can be very bad for the Fed
1527322945961414657,2022-05-19 16:19:01+00:00,81,10,6 10 While BofA respondents see the hiking cycle having 7 9 hikes including the three already completed the fed funds futures market is pricing in twelve hikes before at least pausing
1527322885567967232,2022-05-19 16:18:46+00:00,83,8,5 10 The BofA Survey focuses on LT debt equity mgrs ST debt mgrs are few Normally these groups give the same answer not now But the FF fut mkt odds of a 50 bps hike in June AND July is 100 35 of the survey thinks the Fed will stop before completing these 50 bps hikes
1527322862809661441,2022-05-19 16:18:41+00:00,104,10,4 10 Despite this mgrs expect just 7 9 hikes in total this cycle Roughly 25 think the Fed will only hike 6 times 10 see just 4 hikes Or 35 surveyed do not believe the Fed will hold true to its word of 100 basis points of hikes in total over the next two meetings
1527322670999535616,2022-05-19 16:17:55+00:00,127,10,3 10 Above mgrs are now more worried about recession than inflation The Fed is not The Fed has hiked three times so far this year 25 in March and 50 in May They promised to hike 50 basis points at each of the next couple meetings That would mean 7 rate hikes by July
1527322665488629760,2022-05-19 16:17:54+00:00,139,16,2 10 BofA released its monthly Global Fund Survey for May covering 288 managers One of the most interesting results came from a question about tail risks This month hawkish central banks and global recession replaced inflation and the war as the biggest tail risks

1526186677231837185,2022-05-16 13:03:53+00:00,0,0,Ocelot Who said anything about CL not being fine I said they let the crypto community down No argument has been offered why you did not Just a bunch of CYA the code worked as designed excuses CL has to better than that you agree
1526186117220933634,2022-05-16 13:01:40+00:00,6,0,Being My concern is attitudes like yours Why don t you consider the user of an oracle instead just grabbing Kwon s money to give him whatever he wants Why weren t proper safeguards written into a circuit breaker for an algo coin prone to a hyperinflationary event
1526183464126513153,2022-05-16 12:51:07+00:00,0,0,Ocelot CL bears no liability But it speaks volumes about its culture that you defend doing Do Kwon s bidding and not interested in the protocols that relied on your oracle and failed Good luck with this reasoning CL is opening itself up to competition
1526174841522507779,2022-05-16 12:16:51+00:00,1,0,This thread is most likely lower my count
1526174532263989251,2022-05-16 12:15:38+00:00,1,0,Yes you accurately delivered exactly what Do Kwon wanted without mistake All the while knowing it did not serve the best interests of the users of your oracle Is that how you really want the world to view CL
1526172711394938881,2022-05-16 12:08:23+00:00,0,0,If CL is laughing at the fact that users of their oracle relied on them to look after their interests and they did not causing entire protocols to fail then you did a better job of explaining why link of 87 off its peak than I can ever do
1526160029237366784,2022-05-16 11:18:00+00:00,0,0,What responsibility does CL have to the users of their oracle What did they do to advocate for their interests This is where sounds like a mid level bank employee insisting it was spelled out in the smart contract or terms of service Even Aave lost money
1526154432328749059,2022-05-16 10:55:45+00:00,0,0,Everyone did and how about the small protocols that collapsed because CL just followed the flawed parameters Kwon gave them and their oracle pricing failed them shouldn t we expect more from CL than it crap but programmed correctly
1526011858494410752,2022-05-16 01:29:13+00:00,0,0,sbr here you go
1526011205055397896,2022-05-16 01:26:37+00:00,1,0,Beast Really good comments thank you Unlike earlier today that sounded like a mid level bureaucrat dev at a big bank we gave created a flawed oracle but also clearly documented the flaw so what are you whining about We expect more from CL
