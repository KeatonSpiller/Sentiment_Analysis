1600952902322769920,2022-12-08 20:38:10+00:00,2,0,Again We think PBM and TPA peers are right but if you want to mindlessly compare PGNY to health care tech peers it chooses in its proxy fine
1600900607585681408,2022-12-08 17:10:22+00:00,1,0,that blue chip corporate clients are not defaulting on payments in a material way then what must the default rate on member payments be to drive a 2 of TOTAL revs bad debt rate And why don't other TPAs and PBMs have any material bad debt expense but PGNY does
1600900604485718016,2022-12-08 17:10:22+00:00,0,1,Image from a sell side defense of PGNY Folks we dedicated an entire section of our report to explaining what it means if these WERE indeed legitimate bad debt expenses lt 2 sounds small but member payments are a single digit percentage of revenues If you assume
1600568873895477281,2022-12-07 19:12:11+00:00,5,0,What KeyBanc is saying is a transparently stupid straw man version of one specific sub point in our thesis We actually debated not including that chart because people might intentionally misinterpret it as the point but we bet that nobody could be that dishonest
1600568871815102485,2022-12-07 19:12:10+00:00,8,1,We're told KeyBanc is cherrypicking a select chart from our report to make it look like our PGNY argument is wow margins went up 100bps from accounting games in this one quarter That's not what we're saying We're saying this
1600562105890918401,2022-12-07 18:45:17+00:00,2,0,3 3 Progyny's investor relations confirmed to KeyBanc the most important message to convey is that we have no concerns about the integrity of our financial reporting or the accuracy of our financial statements Well that's good
1600562103064006658,2022-12-07 18:45:17+00:00,1,0,2 3 We conveniently dedicated pp 22 25 of today's report to debunking this exact excuse Part of the reason we like this short is that the management explanation doesn't hold water
1600562097318133760,2022-12-07 18:45:15+00:00,1,0,1 3 As previously known PGNY amended rebate receivables which caused an increase in DSO KeyBanc analyst via Bloomberg defending PGNY Really

1600494058559905793,2022-12-07 14:14:53+00:00,7,0,8 8 We calculate that these and other clever tools are the only thing keeping reported profits and cash flows positive at PGNY Easy borrow low short interest Full report at
1600494056429293571,2022-12-07 14:14:53+00:00,8,0,7 8 In our fieldwork calls we found that industry experts expect sustainable gross margins out of this business that are you guessed it about 900bps lower than what the company reports One former PGNY executive said the reported revenues flat out never made sense to him
1600494054403411976,2022-12-07 14:14:52+00:00,6,0,6 8 Before stock compensation PGNY has negative cash flow from operations and this deficit is getting worse Why do sell side analysts think this business actually generates cash Reflexivity The more your stock falls the more stock you need to issue to pay bills
1600494050536210434,2022-12-07 14:14:52+00:00,6,0,5 8 But hey what if we re wrong about 3 In that case PGNY is a deep subprime lender with huge member default rates We re in near Goldilocks consumer macro conditions today If bad debt expense normalizes modestly higher reported EBIT could get wiped out
1600494046476214277,2022-12-07 14:14:51+00:00,6,0,4 8 PGNY has corporate clients with high credit quality Facebook Amazon etc So why are bad debt expenses so astronomically high compared to similar benefit managers We think this is the other side of systematically overstated revenues
1600494041841520642,2022-12-07 14:14:49+00:00,6,0,3 8 In Q421 PGNY changed 10 K accounting language to make this change and the numbers blew out that very same quarter We estimate this had 7m of gross profit benefit in Q322 alone
1600494037861031941,2022-12-07 14:14:49+00:00,6,0,2 8 Three quick steps to inflating profits A Stop using historical gross margins when booking today s expenses B Start using expected margins C Expect ridiculously high margins It s actually that simple And you can see the impact in PGNY numbers

1590348883368239104,2022-11-09 14:21:35+00:00,5,1,3 questions for ARRY 1 Why did founder amp COO both resign in last month 2 You told us that STI had 30 gross margins why didn't you clarify the inventory production anomaly 3 How much cash flow benefit did you get in 9m22 from liquidating old STI AR and Inventory
1590348881581068288,2022-11-09 14:21:35+00:00,4,0,4 Remember how we said the 30 gross margin ARRY claimed for STI was a red herring and long term STI margins are much lower They finally began acknowledging this look at the Q amp A with the Goldman analyst on the call What else is a red herring
1590348879882772480,2022-11-09 14:21:34+00:00,2,0,If ARRY can't generate meaningful organic FCF in a period of windfall pull forward sales and deliveries when exactly is it supposed to do so
1590348878288941056,2022-11-09 14:21:34+00:00,3,0,3 But wow a great cash flow number right 43m legal settlement one time 63m enormous inventory destocking one time Without these no CFFO Inv destocking is consistent with our thesis remember how STI brought one time working capital FCF benefits
1590348876619608064,2022-11-09 14:21:34+00:00,3,0,Restatement relates to contract accounting they overstated revenues and STI's gross margin they understated COGS See our report this is familiar Oh and they found yet another material weakness Auditors should have a fun time with this company's audit in Feb 2023

1590348873272131584,2022-11-09 14:21:33+00:00,13,5,ARRY If you can afford to look at all the holes amp warnings in this print it's well worth it It's part of a pattern with this company A short thread on Q322 followed by questions for management please enjoy
1589625225465200640,2022-11-07 14:26:02+00:00,11,0,Funny how this article mentions NMC Health without mentioning who caught the fraud in the first place
1582044230830039040,2022-10-17 16:21:52+00:00,6,1,It gets better Anyone notice that ARRY waited to tell the market until SIX DAYS after the guy gave his notice From the 8k released today

1570401847831302145,2022-09-15 13:19:11+00:00,6,0,4 7 After years of horrific cash burn investors are excited by ARRY s FY22 guide of 100m positive FCF But look up Spanish filings of STI Norland which ARRY recently acquired STI delayed collecting receivables prior to acquisition Receivables worth um almost 100m

1570401844383580161,2022-09-15 13:19:11+00:00,4,0,2 7 Per one former employee ARRY would book revs without even having manufactured the product let alone having shipped it Another ARRY s claims of a 20 gross margin are crazy amp real gross margin is approx 10 11 Street is modeling 20 margin for 23 amp beyond

1570142279225974787,2022-09-14 20:07:45+00:00,30,8,Tomorrow morning we'll release a new short idea with very low days to cover We'll also be discussing this idea in our first interview on You can also sign up for our mailing list at
1555556110395916288,2022-08-05 14:07:32+00:00,2,1,Either you include both new recvbles amp principal paybacks in which case cash flow is horrendous or you include neither in which case it's just bad And we aren't even addressing the return OF capital component of EMI This is a joke but it's a great one
1555556109267640321,2022-08-05 14:07:31+00:00,2,0,and if you listen to the call the CEO is very quick to walk back any suggestion that this is a new metric So this is called Adj CF from Ops plus Other Portfolio Collections because that's a meaningless statement Returns of principal are exactly that
1555556108160360449,2022-08-05 14:07:31+00:00,2,0,if you loan someone 100 and he pays you back 100 later with no interest you have made no money No FCF Nothing As a measure of FCF this is nonsense But look again at the slide does HASI actually call it FCF or adj FCF or something similar Why no they don't
1555556106197426178,2022-08-05 14:07:31+00:00,3,1,is Slide 16 which one analyst referred to as debunking the bear case on cash flow This claim is truly incredible and insane Principal collections from receivables are included in this non metric metric but not investments in new receivables Think about that
1555556102552666112,2022-08-05 14:07:30+00:00,2,0,the 10 Q comes out likely Friday after the close investors will find another large writedown of Securitization Residual Assets through AOCI Our report talks about how this has bad implications for gains on sale But our favorite part
1555556101323718656,2022-08-05 14:07:30+00:00,9,1,The HASI Q2 print is a doozy It confirms several of our reasons for being short We'll discuss two Thread below 1 Look at Securitization Assets on the balance sheet These fell for the second quarter in a row We believe that when
1550477499708198912,2022-07-22 13:46:57+00:00,14,2,While our HASI thesis is completely different from and incremental to the Muddy Waters thesis we have gone over that thesis in detail and we can't find a single point we disagree with And accounting is our core competency There are just a lot of ways to win on this short
1550468741271543808,2022-07-22 13:12:08+00:00,9,1,4 4 In a nutshell We think nearly 50 of HASI's earnings are going away this year b c of things that have already happened Also puts dividend at risk Even if the accounting is clean PDF with 17 pages of explanation is available to all at
1550468739690369024,2022-07-22 13:12:08+00:00,5,0,Now flip it around You originated that loan when rates were 1 5 but rates went to 3 If you sell you get a massive loss on sale Most of HASI's loan book is 2019 21 low rate vintage Look at Q1 AOCI Already marking down Can't sell losers Rates surged AGAIN in Q2
1550468737551187968,2022-07-22 13:12:08+00:00,4,0,50 of HASI earnings are gains on sale of very long duration loans If you originated a long term low yield loan when risk free rate was 3 and rates go to 1 5 you've got a huge winner Sell it and you get a gain on sale That explains HASI's lovely 2020 amp 2021
1550468735911198721,2022-07-22 13:12:07+00:00,30,9,We're short HASI And for completely different reasons than those raised by Muddy Waters This short is far more timely than most people realize Earnings can't withstand the new rate environment Even if the accounting were squeaky clean It's about gains on sale 1 4

1453802906382225410,2021-10-28 19:16:37+00:00,2,0,Initial purchase price plus deferred payments to date now add up to 62m Did MXL pay 62m for a business that would never contribute revenues Doubtful Did it pay its usual discount to revenues which could imply north of 25m qtr inorganic contribution

1447901667052171268,2021-10-12 12:27:12+00:00,3,0,5 5 Why do MXL analysts model such a massive immediate acceleration in organic growth Because they don t realize it s an acceleration MXL removed inorganic information after Q420 We had to piece together old footnotes to figure this one out we of course show our work
1447901665840046082,2021-10-12 12:27:12+00:00,4,0,4 5 MXL s credibility is a joke They ve repeatedly walked investors off cliffs by promising growth in declining business lines Our report walks through a list of bizarre and hilarious company proclamations about various product growth rates that never made sense
1447901664581664769,2021-10-12 12:27:12+00:00,1,0,3 5 MXL is chronically declining because it s a roll up of chronically declining assets Avg annual organic decline rate is around 10 MXL s acquisitions regularly enjoy a short lived boost then return to state of decline IHG appears to be on phase two of that template

1425809867240058886,2021-08-12 13:22:17+00:00,2,0,Jefferies research just published a note regurgitating AHCO's absurdity of 10 organic growth AFTER the 10 Q was out with new disclosure that clearly shows it negative Jefferies banking is co running today's AHCO debt issuance We're all just trying to make a living
1425523153288237059,2021-08-11 18:22:59+00:00,3,0,From S amp P's rating note of AHCO's new debt issuance today The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the company will increase its organic revenue by the high single digit percent area So many of the thought leaders in the market still have no idea about this one
1425452020035620867,2021-08-11 13:40:19+00:00,0,0,2 2 Given that 2H20 had revenues of 663m the extra 40m is worth around 6 points of faux organic growth to 2H21 alone See what the game is here If they sandbagged Spiro by this much it matters a lot to guidance
1425452018555138055,2021-08-11 13:40:19+00:00,0,0,1 2 What would it mean if Spiro Health were an 80m contributor to FY21 revenues not sub 40m as mgmt says Implies around 60m of revenue contribution for 2H21 Mgmt had suggested more like 20m This implies around 40m of faux organic growth from Spiro alone in 2H21
1425436690542432265,2021-08-11 12:39:25+00:00,3,0,7 7 Think about what else this new info teaches us It quantifies only 1H21 but validates our methodology for earlier periods which found deeply negative growth in 2H20 and 0 over the long term We are short here and recommend you revisit AHCO with fresh eyes
1425436689200304141,2021-08-11 12:39:24+00:00,3,1,6 7 New information also appears to validate our view that AHCO is buying companies of X revenues and calling them 0 5x in order to claim the other 0 5x is organic Spiro Health is the best example of this This has implications for guidance trajectory and sustainability
1425436687912640516,2021-08-11 12:39:24+00:00,2,0,5 7 Now it's just a matter of time before the investing public observes that organic growth is negative in plain sight and that this company has no hope of a long term organic trajectory of anything approaching 8 10 They'll be lucky to have positive organic over time
1425436686624886790,2021-08-11 12:39:24+00:00,5,0,4 7 because who sits around waiting for 10 Qs to come out late on a summer Friday and then looks for minor changes At least one sell side firm published a note AFTER 10 Q was out and appears not to have read it at all They are still celebrating 10 organic growth
1425436685429510144,2021-08-11 12:39:23+00:00,2,1,3 7 In its 10 Q the company made a tiny change to its disclosure finally offering full quantification of its inorganic growth This tiny change allows us to see that organic growth is indeed negative just under 0 in Q2 and approximately 8 in Q1 Few noticed
1425436684058087424,2021-08-11 12:39:23+00:00,2,0,2 7 Management insisted on its earnings call last week that yes organic growth is in fact 10 Virtually the entire sell side took this at face value Of course all this sent the stock up dramatically on heavy volume The next day 5 30pm on a Friday the 10 Q came out
1425436682606817282,2021-08-11 12:39:23+00:00,10,2,1 7 We're updating our AHCO short with new information that conclusively proves negative organic growth for all of 2021 so far The opportunity to short AHCO at this level again is incredible neg org growth confirmed short interest low stock back to pre report levels

1423619993476993027,2021-08-06 12:20:30+00:00,0,0,10 x Is nobody going to ask this company how much in revenues Spiro is doing The pro forma math on slide 7 tells us that had Q221 deals been completed on March 31 revs would have been 15m higher 632m 617m If Spiro is even 2 3 of that then it's 10m month or 120m yr
1423619992331882502,2021-08-06 12:20:30+00:00,1,0,9 x Since when is it so difficult for a home health business to calculate traditional organic growth Aerocare wasn t unique in figuring theirs out remember in our report page 31 where we show ADUS and AMED calculating these numbers Is AHCO the only one who won't do it
1423619990897532930,2021-08-06 12:20:30+00:00,0,0,8 x They removed the historical numbers on organic growth from their slide deck We think it s because they got caught restating them retroactively without disclosing it However they forgot to change the slide title Consistent strength isn t demonstrated by one quarter
1423619987789524992,2021-08-06 12:20:29+00:00,0,0,7 x Next think for a second about how bad the true organic growth must be for them to work so hard on avoiding it If it were anywhere near 8 10 they d undoubtedly answer with our same store growth is X about the same as our little homemade organic growth number
1423619986619342855,2021-08-06 12:20:29+00:00,0,0,6 x And of course since when should investors not care about underlying or organic or same store or whatever you want to call it growth That s where these guys are going to try and take this to avoid disclosing it What kind of investor falls for this nonsense
1423619985373532172,2021-08-06 12:20:28+00:00,0,0,5 x Further if traditional organic growth is so meaningless as the CEO says then why does AHCO spend so much time on pro forma growth You know why The CEO s argument above attacking same store growth shoots the usefulness of pro forma growth in the head as well
1423619983825833984,2021-08-06 12:20:28+00:00,2,0,4 x If the CEO believes that same store growth is pointless and impossible to calculate how did THIS SAME CEO report it just last year for Aerocare when he was that company's CEO See slide from Aerocare merger
1423619980034252800,2021-08-06 12:20:27+00:00,1,0,3 x For instance when asked bluntly about the elephant in the room AHCO's real organic growth management s response included a variety of dismissals of the value of the same store growth metric The CEO goes as far as to suggest it might even be impossible
1423619974036402177,2021-08-06 12:20:26+00:00,0,0,2 x Management has planted a flag and it reads We aren t going to disclose true organic growth and if you don t like it this is not the stock for you Some analysts asked on the call about what this same store growth metric They were rebuffed at every turn
1423619972685869056,2021-08-06 12:20:25+00:00,2,0,1 x Below are our thoughts on AHCO Q221 earnings The one caveat is that the 10 Q is not out yet and that is crucial to our analysis We expect this to be filed next week Most apparently AHCO is doubling down on its misleading organic growth in its reporting

1420442055118106625,2021-07-28 17:52:31+00:00,6,0,Our advice to AHCO for the August 5 report Just report organic growth in the traditional way and be done with it Baird note today in response to our report That's actually good advice It isn't the new CEO's problem he can just blame the opacity on the old CEO

1399452304982609923,2021-05-31 19:46:44+00:00,7,0,1 2 Hi again everyone we were honored to help investors understand accounting games in the public markets through our DOX report We expect our thesis to be proven ultimately by events rather than by jawboning so we will not be commenting on DOX for the foreseeable future
1377239479380021249,2021-03-31 12:40:54+00:00,7,0,We are revealing the results of a months long examination of what we believe are damning financial anomalies at Amdocs DOX Full report at
1377235407792918528,2021-03-31 12:24:43+00:00,5,0,We believe that all of these findings raise serious questions as to Amdocs financial position and management s honesty about it Opinions our own but investors beware See website for full report
1377235406266204162,2021-03-31 12:24:43+00:00,5,1,As all of this was happening Amdocs experienced massive auditor turnover at its international subsidiaries Many reputable Big 4 auditors left Amdocs at this time and were replaced by auditors from lower tier or even no name firms
1377235403472781312,2021-03-31 12:24:42+00:00,2,1,Management has historically said that it needs a minimum cash balance of 500m to smoothly fund operations which makes little sense to us We suspect that this 500m figure may represent a sum which is either trapped abroad and thus inaccessible or which simply does not exist
1377235402168352771,2021-03-31 12:24:42+00:00,0,0,Amdocs also recently divested of one of its fastest growing and most profitable subs for just 1x sales half of where DOX trades Why would management rush to do this if there wasn t a need for cash
1377235395419705349,2021-03-31 12:24:40+00:00,0,0,Does DOX have access to all of its cash Interest ballooned through 2019 despite DOX reporting no debt At the same time subsidiary cash balances almost universally fell to zero
1377235374498574336,2021-03-31 12:24:35+00:00,0,0,This gap became noticeable in 2016 the first year in which the accounting red flags shown by began to emerge We believe that the fact that Amdocs started to show weakness just as its reported profitability began to deviate from the subs is not a coincidence
1377235372502056960,2021-03-31 12:24:35+00:00,0,0,Comparing Amdocs margins with those of its subsidiaries taken together suggests that DOX s operating profitability is overstated by 40 50 or as much as 200m An analysis of the international subs suggests that Amdocs is far less profitable than the parent filings show
1377235367783505924,2021-03-31 12:24:34+00:00,0,1,Upon review of dozens of Amdocs international subsidiaries which together represent the vast majority of the biz we find discrepancies suggesting wildly overstated margins misrepresented liquidity at the parent and a flood of auditor resignations within the last several years
1377235366516772869,2021-03-31 12:24:33+00:00,7,2,We are revealing the results of a months long examination of what we believe are damning financial anomalies at Amdocs DOX Impossible to stay silent in light of findings Full report at
