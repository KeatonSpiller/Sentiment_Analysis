1600514272823500802,2022-12-07 15:35:13+00:00,2,1,We believe GWH took significant efforts to conceal its relationship with ESI before announcing their big agreement which makes us believe that management is trying to deliberately mislead investors
1600514175117262848,2022-12-07 15:34:50+00:00,1,0,We found that ESI this supposedly massive strategic partner has no discernible activities outside of its work with GWH

1541793835965186048,2022-06-28 14:41:10+00:00,56,7,Yes you read that right the Chinese government invested 1bn in 2020 in NIO China and already was paid back 2bn and is owed another 6bn Ask yourself who is getting the short end of the stick
1541793224410501121,2022-06-28 14:38:44+00:00,25,2,Chinese government entities have redeemed US 2B from NIO and may collect another US 6 7B With NIO cash balance of just US 8 2B We believe shareholders risk being materially diluted in future periods
1541793144387272704,2022-06-28 14:38:25+00:00,23,2,In an apparent violation of these Users trust Li pledged these shares to UBS to secure a personal loan With NIO stock declining 50 since the pledge we believe shareholders are unknowingly exposed to the risk of a margin call against the Users Trust shares
1541793089488035843,2022-06-28 14:38:12+00:00,18,2,In January 2019 Bin Li transferred 50M shares to the NIO Users Trust an opaque BVI entity purportedly established to provide NIO Users with more influence over the Company s governance

1541792920679882753,2022-06-28 14:37:32+00:00,20,1,Of course it would take a willing potential accomplice to pull off such a scheme While NIO represents limited control over Weineng we identified notable conflicts of interest between the two parties

1541792809639895041,2022-06-28 14:37:05+00:00,19,1,Considering Weineng s recent disclosure of 19 000 battery subscriptions we questioned why Weineng held 40 053 batteries as inventory on September 30 2021 We believe NIO flooded Weineng with up to extra 21 053 batteries worth 1 147M RMB to boost its numbers
1541792777348026369,2022-06-28 14:36:57+00:00,30,1,Through this arrangement we think NIO has juiced its numbers by pulling forward 7 years of revenue
1541792736210190342,2022-06-28 14:36:48+00:00,31,1,By transferring the burden of collecting monthly subscriptions to Weineng NIO has accelerated its revenue growth Instead of recognizing revenue over the life of the subscription 7 years Weineng allows NIO to recognize revenue from the batteries they sell immediately
1541792674239348736,2022-06-28 14:36:33+00:00,30,1,We believe sales to Weineng have inflated NIO revenue and net income by 10 and 95 respectively Specifically we find that at least 60 of its FY2021 earnings beat seems attributable to Weineng
1541792611605831682,2022-06-28 14:36:18+00:00,30,2,While this rapid growth is impressive on the surface our investigation has found Weineng might be to NIO what Philidor was to Valeant Just as Philidor aided Valeant in habitually making numbers NIO has curiously exceeded estimates since establishing Weineng

1508811686886752267,2022-03-29 14:21:53+00:00,4,1,We believe EMO will not win the Aznalc llar Appeal regardless of the legal outcome of the other party due to a lack of resources that disqualified them initially which continues to plague the company Management conveniently fails to address this among other key risks

1508810460946214921,2022-03-29 14:17:00+00:00,3,0,Our Spanish investigator uncovered government emails that outlined that EMO was banned from one Spanish region from submitting offers for mines due to reckless behavior and countless breaches Does this tie their hands for the rest of their Spanish projects

1489260502123384845,2022-02-03 15:32:27+00:00,2,0,PLTK in our opinion is a quintessential example of a pattern we frequently see in today s market environment Chinese insiders bring their companies public in the US when faced with regulatory changes which invalidates their business Chinese education companies etc

1489260260237844484,2022-02-03 15:31:29+00:00,4,1,PLTK employs an aggressive roll up strategy This aggressive roll up strategy creates the illusion of growth while masking the underlying decline of PLTK s legacy games
1489260179803676675,2022-02-03 15:31:10+00:00,4,1,PLTK seems like a low quality business with a huge regulatory risk that we believe will materialize soon The company s focus on online casino games and aggressive monetization is not viewed kindly by regulators and the player base

1466430011582435343,2021-12-02 15:32:14+00:00,16,3,In summary we believe SOL is a fraudulent company that drastically overrepresents its project pipeline to access the US capital markets SOL is led by what we believe to be a fraudulent team whose legal difficulties will ultimately also cause problems for SOL shareholders
1466429943538139139,2021-12-02 15:31:58+00:00,8,0,We believe that the legal difficulties of SOL biggest shareholder will cause significant issues for shareholders at some point in the future SOL
1466429854488932360,2021-12-02 15:31:36+00:00,3,0,SOL spun off several entities to Li in 2017 these entities are now in substantial legal trouble Judgments in China against Li and related entities amount to over 1 billion RMB These are real judgments that authorities will pursue and collect on
1466429800936054791,2021-12-02 15:31:24+00:00,3,0,Former chairman Xianshou Li remains SOL biggest shareholder but is officially not engaged in management Our research indicates that Li secretly still exercises substantial control over SOL
1466429753351720974,2021-12-02 15:31:12+00:00,5,0,We believe SOL has terrible corporate governance as evidenced by a seemingly relative of former Chairman Xianshou Li serving on SOL board of directors while being in her 20s and having very limited experience that could justify such a position
1466429688029528075,2021-12-02 15:30:57+00:00,7,0,SOL continuously categorizes projects as late stage and close to finalization which our research shows to be either non existent or delayed for years Even the projects that we could identify were for the most part delayed by years and way behind company projections
1466429634413830151,2021-12-02 15:30:44+00:00,6,0,It seems to us that SOL has fabricated projects to give the appearance of a better development pipeline and future economics SOL
1466429565778157569,2021-12-02 15:30:28+00:00,7,0,Most of SOL projects are in Europe but our research indicates that most of these projects seemingly do not exist We were able to confirm this in several cases with the local government authorities SOL SOL

1453014352445984768,2021-10-26 15:03:11+00:00,5,0,The operations team in charge seems to be the same that led the company into bankruptcy in its previous iteration
1453014287786594313,2021-10-26 15:02:56+00:00,8,2,MP core management team lacks natural resources credibility and consists of financial engineers Management is not so confi dent in themselves either as they have sold close to 356M worth of stock since going public
1453014246908911628,2021-10-26 15:02:46+00:00,11,2,MP has been able to ride the green energy and Electric Vehicle hype by mischaracterizing its business and grouping itself with names like TSLA The chosen valuation comps and metrics are a huge red flag to us
1453014121272774664,2021-10-26 15:02:16+00:00,5,1,MP mine generates nowhere near the economic essence needed to support the current valuation due to the fact that MP mostly mines less valuable rare earth namely Cerium and Lanthanum It does not participate in the favorable trend in rare earth prices like competitors do
1453014032403816478,2021-10-26 15:01:55+00:00,10,1,When comparing MP and Molycorp side by side it appears that MP current plan is almost an identical copy of Molycorp s failed Project Phoenix from almost 10 years ago
1453013962203844613,2021-10-26 15:01:38+00:00,13,0,MP is the second iteration of the same mining venture Molycorp that previously ended in bankruptcy However and his friends were able to bring MP public again at a 300x valuation increase in only three years without significant business improvements we could find
1453013890833555456,2021-10-26 15:01:21+00:00,14,0,We found that Shenghe a related party that accounts for 99 of MP revenue and a significant shareholder can be traced back to the Chinese central government This has been overlooked so far and could potentially pose a national security concern
1453013803994685441,2021-10-26 15:01:01+00:00,12,2,MP was able to sell itself to investors touting the fact that MP is the largest rare earth producer in the western world and the only feasible competitor to Chinese producers In reality we believe that this is nothing more than a smoke and mirrors show

1445026707593891849,2021-10-04 14:03:09+00:00,1,0,PKK CA scheme runs deeper than fake acquisitions It reported vast revenue growth in its Fintech segment but Chinese subsidiary filings from SAIC expose that PKK CA has never owned Asia Synergy Financial Capital the main operating subsidiary despite claiming to own 51
1445026616728489989,2021-10-04 14:02:47+00:00,1,0,Even if PKK CA purchased these assets they have nominal value and were grossly overpaid for Both Heartbeat and Jinxiaoer generate almost zero revenue low registered capital and limited to no web traffic history
1445026554027851780,2021-10-04 14:02:32+00:00,1,0,PKK CA is not new to the shell game In December 2019 they claimed to direct 1 4m towards a 70 stake in loan brokerage platform Jinxiaoer but filings uncover PKK has never owned Jinxiaoer either
1445026489766981634,2021-10-04 14:02:17+00:00,1,0,While PKK CA touted its 30m September 2021 acquisition of Heartbeat a China insurance company we reveal the entity that received these funds is a potentially undisclosed related party that does not even own Heartbeat
1445026426869239808,2021-10-04 14:02:02+00:00,1,0,PKK CA evolution is questionable at best The company pivoted from failed wannabe Find My iPhone software to revenue less IT services to a fully impaired e commerce platform before becoming a hub for commercial lending in China

1425102935382450184,2021-08-10 14:33:11+00:00,17,1,We conclude that TSP is nothing but an empty box that was nicely packaged and irresponsibly dumped on US investors We see the stock losing up to 50 within a short to medium timeframe once the hype is over
1425102885474508807,2021-08-10 14:32:59+00:00,12,0,Despite TSP 's attempt to distance itself from its China origins the regulatory uncertainty revolving around Chinese companies listed abroad puts huge headwind on the company s already uncertain future
1425102757334290439,2021-08-10 14:32:29+00:00,7,0,In our view the TSP is particularly vague about their technology due to them simply lacking differentiated technology While the company touts its 1 000 meter LIDAR sensors they are really enabled by third party LIDAR providers that are non exclusive to TSP
1425102710857207815,2021-08-10 14:32:18+00:00,6,0,This relationship is zero risk for Navistar and all the burden lies with TSP While Navistar helps TSP push KPIs it made over 200M from its March 2021 pre IPO investments in TSP alone
1425102653839839237,2021-08-10 14:32:04+00:00,8,0,TSP presents Navistar as a key customer In reality TSP has to reimburse Navistar 10m for expenses TSP is not making any money from this relationship anytime soon instead they are paying Navistar for the opportunity to use its name
1425102560927563777,2021-08-10 14:31:42+00:00,6,0,however this revenue could be cancelled anytime by the customer and the 500 deposit is completely refundable The SEC sent a letter to TSP to clarify and they ended up deleting the whole revenue forecast
1425102526181949453,2021-08-10 14:31:34+00:00,5,0,TSP has managed to fool both sell side analysts and investors on pre order numbers that seem to equate to hundreds and millions of dollar in revenue The 5 700 pre orders Nikola had 7 000 the company touted equate to 420m in potential revenue
1425102459089956871,2021-08-10 14:31:18+00:00,7,0,TSP founders Mo Chen and Xiaodi Hou have a history of failure that is filled with bankruptcies and suspended business licenses The founders track record is spun by the company as successful but a deeper look makes them seem remarkably ill equipped
1425102390366253064,2021-08-10 14:31:01+00:00,7,0,Did you know that TSP and NKLA have a lot more in common than it may appear For example Both companies are financed by the same bad actors namely VectoIQ aka Stephen Girsky The existence of this investor was conveniently removed from TSP investor presentations

1380170651131113476,2021-04-08 14:48:20+00:00,26,3,Last thoughts The answer to the GSX issue is not a margin call Also don t believe everything you read in the news even if it comes from people familiar with the matter We suspect there is a lot more to the GSX manipulation than we currently know
1380170604163313665,2021-04-08 14:48:09+00:00,41,6,GSX really exemplifies the worst in today s market Rampant market manipulation crazy leverage obviously fraudulent financials and regulators failing to act Of course our investment banks are key enablers
1380170546604875779,2021-04-08 14:47:55+00:00,18,1,Reason 7 The key reason why we believe cannot sign GSX annual audit is that the consequences will be brutal has a substantial China business and should not risk it over a single fraudulent company
1380170462471331850,2021-04-08 14:47:35+00:00,27,4,Reason 6 GSX is the most exposed fraud case in history Whistleblower lawsuits confirm the worst allegations short sellers have made over the last year How long can Enforcement blatantly ignore the mountain of evidence
1380170378056720387,2021-04-08 14:47:15+00:00,13,1,Reason 5 We pointed out in our very first publication in February 2020 that we believe GSX land acquisition involved CAPEX fraud and that GSX overreported the purchase price of the land meaningfully has insight into the original documents underlying the transaction
1380170325317582849,2021-04-08 14:47:02+00:00,15,2,Reason 4 The recent market manipulation allegations surrounding bad actors in GSX are staggering This makes the mysterious private placement in December 2020 even more troublesome The placement was done without a broker and without revealing the identity of the buyers
1380170258212872192,2021-04-08 14:46:46+00:00,21,1,Reason 3 We believe the long term investment balance of GSX is simply falsified Do we really want to find out that all it would have taken to reveal the fraud is a call by the auditor to the banks supposedly holding these giant investment accounts Wirecard all over again
1380170157088247817,2021-04-08 14:46:22+00:00,12,1,Reason 2 Most of GSX teachers are fake in our opinion can simply cross check teacher identities with their teacher certification number and the employment contract with GSX We doubt that most of the teachers exist See also
1380170086879739911,2021-04-08 14:46:05+00:00,14,1,Reason 1 Abruptly exploding expenses After a rosy outlook on the 2Q 2020 call marketing expenses suddenly exploded We believe there are no underlying bank wires for most of the expenses and those that do exist are with captive marketing companies that circle back cash

1349756934845575173,2021-01-14 16:35:05+00:00,0,0,We modeled out Q4 guidance based on streamer performance data and project a decrease on both a YoY and QoQ basis We believe further deterioration is soon to follow and the impact will be long lasting
1349756819456073732,2021-01-14 16:34:37+00:00,3,1,We believe that even AMZN stock would have gotten hit if second most prominent streamer had been arrested by the police The market seems to not have fully realized today s revelations about DOYU and the implication

1349756257658404866,2021-01-14 16:32:23+00:00,5,0,DOYU opted to not give revenues guidance for Q4 for the first time since it went public likely due to the dim quarter following the crackdown of many DOYU streamers due to illegal online gambling
1349756146513555456,2021-01-14 16:31:57+00:00,7,1,MOMO another online streaming platform based in China recently presented terrible financial performance in light of structural reform We believe this is an indicator of what is to come to DOYU
1349756057581723649,2021-01-14 16:31:36+00:00,8,0,Recent policy announcements indicate a more stringent regulatory environment that is cracking down on online gambling order brushing and faking operating numbers We believe the full scale of the policy reform will be massive

1319285220877561857,2020-10-22 14:31:22+00:00,1,0,We found out that the key Chinese EV partner doesn t have any current operations and all business was halted over a year ago Site visits and calls with distributors confirmed our suspicions
1319285127659225089,2020-10-22 14:31:00+00:00,2,0,Recently in September 2020 SPI stock ran high after it launched a company called EdisonFuture Inc focusing on the design and development of electric vehicles EV and EV charging solutions
1319285076312559623,2020-10-22 14:30:47+00:00,1,1,We believe SPI is an egregious pump and dump company The company s stock has had a date with almost all the hottest trends in the recent two years including Cryptocurrency CBD and now Electric Vehicles

1314567621396881413,2020-10-09 14:05:19+00:00,1,0,We visited Func Food headquarter and did dozens of store checks in Sweden Our conclusion CELH is not what it portrays itself to be

1314567356593647621,2020-10-09 14:04:15+00:00,1,0,It is not surprising these concerns have not been addressed as CELH auditor Assurance Dimensions has a far from stellar track record and in our view seems ill equipped to spot misrepresentations
1314567293293268994,2020-10-09 14:04:00+00:00,2,0,Combine this with the apparent fraudulent track record of key individuals and an auditor who seems ill equipped to detect fraud and you have yourself a perfect set up for a bad awakening We see CELH declining to a price target of 9 99 and potentially much lower
1314567221881044994,2020-10-09 14:03:43+00:00,2,0,Given the risks noted in this report we believe investors should exercise caution when thinking about the growth that judging by market valuation is assumed to be a foregone conclusion CELH
1314567176783880192,2020-10-09 14:03:33+00:00,3,0,Current CELH shareholders are selling large portions of shares Investors who participated in the 2020 Private Placement immediately offered an on shelf prospectus to dump their shares We see a lack of confidence in their own stock
1314567100271333377,2020-10-09 14:03:14+00:00,4,0,CELH has also rightfully come under scrutiny for misleading advertising We believe the company carefully walks the line with the health benefit claims backed by their own scientific studies Report
1314567006541185025,2020-10-09 14:02:52+00:00,4,0,An executive member of CELH initial Nordic Distributor People s Choice acquired by Func Foods is linked to the Panama Papers
1314566905152274439,2020-10-09 14:02:28+00:00,5,1,There are key individuals with worrying backgrounds that seem largely unknown to investors We believe CELH key shareholder Carl DeSantis has a checkered history of what appears to be fraudulent behavior
1314566846637633537,2020-10-09 14:02:14+00:00,6,1,Our search for a rationale revealed what appears to us to be several troublesome factors indicating Func may have been used for sales manipulation and channel stuffing We highlight rising payables beneficial distribution terms and strong hints at Multi Level Marketing
1314566775367925761,2020-10-09 14:01:57+00:00,4,0,We find CELH acquisition of their Nordic distributor concerning and urge investors to question why management would commit resources to a non core business approaching insolvency with a poor track record of growing brands serving a geography with declining sales

1298260603220328449,2020-08-25 14:07:02+00:00,3,0,We also suspect that LX sold one business unbeknownst to investors to the Chairman's relative
1298260547767476225,2020-08-25 14:06:49+00:00,3,0,One LX owns a debt collection service that has only revenues but reports no costs at all This is either the greatest business in the world or insiders are siphoning off cash
1298260442981085186,2020-08-25 14:06:24+00:00,3,0,We also comment on sell side analysts that try to paint recent announcement as a positive We believe the sell side commentary has been hugely misleading and that LX business model is doomed This picture summarized the stance of the sell side well

1298259440693436416,2020-08-25 14:02:25+00:00,3,0,The Corona Virus pandemic added insult to injury and the consequent shut down of the economy has put a massive number of consumers and consumer loans in default or delinquency
1298259349454770178,2020-08-25 14:02:04+00:00,3,0,LX seems to be still actively engaged in direct peer to peer lending which the company supposedly already halted per regulatory pressure Other companies that have broken p2p restrictions have mostly been shut down and executives were even jailed
1298259229443203076,2020-08-25 14:01:35+00:00,4,0,LX has historically charged Chinese consumers enormous interest rates often above the legal 36 usury rate New regulation in China will significantly limit how much LX can charge to 15 4 therefore putting the entire business model at risk
1298259169288495107,2020-08-25 14:01:21+00:00,3,0,LX reports unfathomably low delinquency rates that we simply do not trust We believe LX is reporting artificially low delinquency rates by essentially giving borrowers who are already in default new funds to make payments This has led to a rapidly deteriorating credit quality
1298259078527873024,2020-08-25 14:00:59+00:00,2,0,The structure utilized by LX exposes its shareholders to enormous losses by guaranteeing payment of loans while putting Chinese lenders This strikes us as a quintessential Heads I win tails you lose situation for current shareholders
